Run ’neath the trees!
Run little races
With each little breeze!

Run down the hillside,
Run up the lane;
Run through the meadow,
Then run back again!
Run and be merry
All through the day!
Run to the country,
Away! Away!

Nasruddin’s Aim
One day, Nasruddin was chatting
with his friends.
He began to boast, “No one can
match my skill in archery.
I string the bow, take an
aim, and shoot an
arrow...
Wh...o...o...sh.
The arrow is sure to hit
bang on the target.”
Hearing this, one of
his friends immediately
brought a bow and
some arrows.
Giving them to
Nasruddin, he said,
“Here, Nasruddin!
Take this bow and
arrows.”
Then pointing towards a
target, he said, “Aim at
that target and shoot an
arrow.”

Nasruddin held the bow in his hands, strung it,
aimed at the target and shot an arrow.
Wh...o...o...o...o...
The arrow didn’t hit the target!
Instead it fell down somewhere in the
middle.
“Ha...ha...ha...ha...”
His friends started
laughing.
They said, “Hey,
Nasruddin! Is this
your best aim?”
“Oh, no!
Not at all,” said
Nasruddin,
defending himself.
“This wasn’t my aim.
It was Azad’s aim.
I just showed you how
the Azad shoots an arrow.”
Saying this, Nasruddin picked
up another arrow.
Once again, he strung the bow, aimed at the target,
and shot the arrow.
This time, the arrow fell a little further than where it
had fallen before.

But it certainly
didn’t hit the target!
They asked Nasruddin,
“And this must be
how you shoot an arrow!”
“Of course not,”
argued Nasruddin.
“Even this aim was not mine.
It was the chief guard’s aim.”
Now somebody remarked,
“Well...
Now who’s next on
the list?”
Hearing
this, all the
friends burst
out laughing.
Nasruddin
didn’t say a word.
He quietly picked up
one more arrow.
And again...
And this time
Nasruddin was really
lucky! The arrow hit
bang on the target!

A Puppet head
You can use an old tennis ball which has lost its bounce, to
make the head of a puppet. She looks like a little girl in a skirt
and is very quick and easy to make.

a tennis ball, needle, wool, coloured cloth.
Method –

1. Start with the head. Make a small hole in
the ball and push a long, thick knittingneedle (about size 3), into it.
2. The needle goes in on one side and right
across inside the ball to touch the opposite
side.
3. The hole needs to be very small, so that it is
difficult to push the needle in. In this way it
will fit tightly and remain firm when you
play with your puppet.

4. Now cut the thick top off an old nylon
sock and stretch it tightly round the
ball, sewing it together down the
back.
5. Take some coloured wool and stick on
the ball. Make plaits. Paint the eyes
and lips on the ball.

THEMES
Importance of games and sports
Building concentration

Teacher's page

Poem : Run!
Story : Nasruddin’s Aim

This Unit develops a concentration for work that children are involved with.
Warm up
Before beginning the poem the teacher can ask the children to run around the class in
silence and then –
Stand straight

Stretch their arms sideways

1. Take a deep breath inhaling
through your nose.

1. Keeping your arms stretched, bring your
hands down from the elbow level.

2. Hold till the count of five.

2. Stretch your arms sideways again.

3. Release the air through your nose.

3. Repeat it five times.

4. Repeat it five times.
Reading time

d
e

While reading the lesson the teacher can talk about concentration that leads to success.
Concentration is essential for studies as well as sports.

The teacher should read the given instructions in the questions very clearly so that the
children understand them and follow them accordingly.
Sharing time
?

Discuss the feelings after running.

?

To keep pace with the activity of running, the teacher can ask the children to read the
poem fast, imagining that they are running and reading (speed and fast-track ?
).

?

Having experienced the running activity children should be encouraged to answer
the talk time correctly.

Creative time

Involve the children with words like racing, diving, jumping, swimming, running, for
example – Racing boats is a sport. A girl is diving. I am jumping. We are running a race.
They can either enact or draw to express the sense of movement (this is an indirect way
of sharing verbs as doing words). These drawings with sight words can be hung in the
class. Teachers may lay more emphasis on the inclusion of sports and games from the
local area. They may organise special sports programmes both before and after school
hours to enable children with special talents for training. Team games such as basket
ball, kabaddi, volleyball can be encouraged.

o
n

Language corner

The lesson deals with a lot of words ending with ‘ing’. The teacher should encourage the
class to use ‘ing’ words in sentences, orally as well as in the written format.
For example:

What are your doing?
I am speaking.

Environment

Let students express their concerns on the environmental degradation around us.
