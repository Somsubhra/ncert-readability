Notes for the Teacher
Beehive, a textbook in English for Class IX, is based on the new syllabus in
English which was prepared as a follow-up to the National Curriculum
Framework , 2005. The curriculum calls for an approach that is rich in
comprehensible input and adopts a language-across-the-curriculum,
multilingual perspective. This reader aims at helping the child to read for
meaning, and to learn to communicate in English with confidence and
accuracy.

Care has been taken to give a central place to the learner in the process
of teaching and learning. Learner-friendly language has been used in
the instructions, and the exercises and activities are addressed to the
child. In this process the teacher is a facilitator or a co-learner.
A rich variety of reading material has been provided to include the literary,
cultural and sociological dimensions of texts. The themes range from
childhood and adolescence, to disability, talent and achievement, to
music, science, and contemporary social and environmental concerns.
The range is as inclusive as possible, keeping in view the interest and
cognitive development of the learners. The book draws on different genres
such as story, biography and autobiography; science fiction; humour;
travelogue; and the one-act play.

The number of poems has been increased to help learners explore this
great source of language, derive the joy of learning through poetry, and
understand the music of words. An attempt has been made to include
different types of poems such as the lyric, the ballad and the humorous
poem.

o
n

The poems have been chosen for their simplicity and suitability in terms
of language and thought. We need not talk about the poet or the
background to the poem, unless the poem seems to demand it. Nor
should we attempt to exhaust all the possibilities of a poem; we should
encourage the students to begin to see some of the possibilities. They
should be guided to apprehend the poem through the visual, the auditory,
the tactile, the intellectual, or the emotional channels, and to understand
the suggestiveness of the images.
An attempt has been made to help the learner develop the skill of
predicting and anticipating what follows. Every good reader should guess
what is coming next. The task ‘Before You Read’ given at the beginning

of each unit is designed for this purpose. Learners should be encouraged
to participate in this activity.
The section ‘Thinking about the Text’ attempts to move from surface
level understanding of the text to critical thinking. The comprehension
exercises given here try to help the learners infer meaning. There are a
few questions which ask for the readers’ judgment; they aim to bring
out the learners’ deeper understanding of the text.
In the section ‘Thinking about Language’:

Vocabulary enrichment has been attempted through a variety of
tasks on the usage of words closely related in meaning, matching
words to meanings, word building (including phrasal verbs), and
reference to the dictionary. An activity on the use of the index has
been included.

•

Attention has been drawn to grammar-in-context that emerges out of
the reading text, e.g. the use of the tenses and voice, reported speech,
conditional and subordinate clauses or phrases, and adverbs.

The communicative skills have been exercised by tasks on Speaking
and Writing. The Speaking tasks call for learners to work in pairs or
groups, (for example) to present an argument, express a viewpoint,
express contrasts, seek or give an opinion, introduce a speaker, tell a
story, enact or read out a play in parts, etc.
There are a variety of writing tasks: help writing newspaper report, an
article for a school magazine, argumentative writing, narration,
description, and picture interpretation.
A small attempt has been made to relate speech and writing by pointing
out similarities and differences. Opportunities for writing in groups and
pairs are provided to get into the task.
We have introduced the old exercise of dictation again but from a
completely different perspective. Dictation has been introduced in its
current, updated form as a variety of activities designed to integrate the
language skills of listening, prior reading, language processing and recall,
and writing, including the appropriate use of punctuation in meaningful
contexts.

o
n

Some exercises also allow scope for the learners’ languages to support
one another’s by asking for reflection on relevant words, or poems or
stories in other languages; and attempt (preliminary as they may be) to
attend to the process of translation. Activities have been suggested to
bring out the relatedness of the learners’ school subjects.

Units 1–3
1. THE FUN THEY HAD
This story takes us to the world of the future where computers will play
a major role. Let the children talk freely about how they imagine the
schools of the future that their own children might go to. You might want
to explain the ideas of ‘virtual reality’ and ‘virtual classroom’. The term
‘virtual reality’ refers to a reality created by computer software, and a
‘virtual classroom’ is not a real classroom but one where learning is
through computer software or the Internet. The children may know what
a robot is, and be able to guess what a robotic teacher would be.

In this unit students are required to present their arguments in a debate.

•

A debate is a contest between two speakers or two groups of speakers
to show skill and ability in arguing.

•

A proposition, a question or a problem is required for this purpose,
which can be spoken for or against.

•

To participate in a debate, one must prepare for it. So, one must
prepare an outline of the main points in the order in which one is
going to argue.

•
•
•
•

The time limit is about four to five minutes.
The speaker addresses the audience.

Every topic/subject has its own vocabulary. These must be learnt.
The speaker addresses the chair (Mr President/Madam), ‘submits’
an argument, ‘appeals’ for sympathetic understanding and support,
‘questions’ the opponent’s views, and ‘concludes’ an argument.

2. THE SOUND

OF

MUSIC

o
n

These biographical pieces tell us of people who have achieved success
and recognition through determination, hard work and courage. The
children may be asked to think of potential barriers to success, and of
people who have overcome them. The second part of the unit encourages
students to think about the rich heritage of Indian music, and our musical
instruments. The portraits of musicians given in the beginning may be
supplemented by others that the children can be asked to bring to class.
A comprehension exercise in Part II encourages children to find words in
the text that express attitudes (positive, negative or neutral) to events,
places, etc. Encourage the children to compare and discuss their answers.
Dictionary entries give us different kinds of information about words. Children
need help in using the dictionary to find specific kinds of information.
Notes for the Teacher / 3

This unit has an exercise that asks students to consult a dictionary and
find out which adjective can be used before a noun, which can be used
after a verb, and which can be used in both ways. You may add some
adjectives to those suggested. Encourage the children also to find more
adjectives of the kinds mentioned. Students may wish to consult (in
addition to the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary), the Longman
Dictionary of Contemporary English, the Collins Cobuild Advanced Learner’s
English Dictionary, and the Word Master (Orient Longman), or any good
dictionary of their choice.

The Speaking exercise asks the students to imagine introducing a
celebrity guest to an audience. It can be made an authentic activity if
students are given a couple of minutes during the morning assembly to
speak to their fellow-pupils about such a person. This would give them
practice in facing an audience, and encourage them to prepare seriously,
by: (i) noting down the important points about the person to be
introduced, (ii) using appropriate phrases to introduce the person
(students should be allowed to think what phrases they want to use).

The Writing Task is an exercise in comparison. Hard work is a trait common
to Evelyn Glennie (Part I, para 5) and Bismillah Khan (Part II, para 5).
Help children identify the paragraphs that tell us about the two musicians’
goals. After they read and understand these parts of the text, they can
organise the ideas in two paragraphs, one on each musician.

3. THE LITTLE GIRL

The aim in this unit is to first read through the story at one go, not worrying
about difficult words or difficult language. Students can read the story for
homework and come to class; or the teacher can read out the story in
class; or the students can read out parts of the story in the class, one
after the other. Let them retell the story again, if necessary, in parts.
The dictionary exercise in this unit shows how a very small common
word can be used in different ways. Students might be interested in
thinking about how they use words in their own language to express
these meanings. They may also think of other words like same, small,
give and take to convey different kids of meaning. Encourage them to
consult a dictionary.

o
n

This is a story about the changing attitude of a girl child towards her
father. The Speaking and Writing exercises encourage the students to
think about the relationship between children and parents. The students
should be encouraged to say or write what they think, and not what the
teacher thinks they should say or write. The aim is not to arrive at
a ‘correct’ answer, but to let every child voice an opinion and express
her/his ideas. It is hoped that children will find the topic of personal
relevance. This will help their ideas and language to flow freely.

1. MARGIE even wrote about it that night in her diary.

On the page headed 17 May 2157, she wrote, “Today
Tommy found a real book!”
It was a very old book. Margie’s grandfather once
said that when he was a little boy his grandfather

told him that there was a time when all stories
were printed on paper.
They turned the pages, which were yellow and
crinkly, and it was awfully funny to read words
that stood still instead of moving the way they were
supposed to — on a screen, you know. And then
when they turned back to the page before, it had
the same words on it that it had had when they
read it the first time.
2.
“Gee,” said Tommy, “what a waste. When you’re
through with the book, you just throw it away, I
guess. Our television screen must have had a million
books on it and it’s good for plenty more. I wouldn’t
throw it away.”
“Same with mine,” said Margie. She was eleven
and hadn’t seen as many telebooks as Tommy had.
He was thirteen.
She said, “Where did you find it?”
“In my house.” He pointed without looking,
because he was busy reading. “In the attic.”
“What’s it about?”
“School.”
3.
Margie was scornful. “School? What’s there to
write about school? I hate school.”
Margie always hated school, but now she hated
it more than ever. The mechanical teacher had been
giving her test after test in geography and she had
been doing worse and worse until her mother had
shaken her head sorrowfully and sent for the County
Inspector.
4.
He was a round little man with a red face and a
whole box of tools with dials and wires. He smiled
at Margie and gave her an apple, then took the
teacher apart. Margie had hoped he wouldn’t know
how to put it together again, but he knew how all
right, and, after an hour or so, there it was again,
large and black and ugly, with a big screen on which
all the lessons were shown and the questions were
asked. That wasn’t so bad. The part Margie hated

crinkly: with many
folds or lines

most was the slot where she had to put homework
and test papers. She always had to write them out
in a punch code they made her learn when she was
six years old, and the mechanical teacher calculated
the marks in no time.
5.
The Inspector had smiled after he was finished
and patted Margie’s head. He said to her mother,
“It’s not the little girl’s fault, Mrs Jones. I think the
geography sector was geared a little too quick. Those
things happen sometimes. I’ve slowed it up to an
average ten-year level. Actually, the overall pattern
of her progress is quite satisfactory.” And he patted
Margie’s head again.
Margie was disappointed. She had been hoping
they would take the teacher away altogether. They
had once taken Tommy’s teacher away for nearly a
month because the history sector had blanked out
completely.
So she said to Tommy, “Why would anyone write
about school?”
6.
Tommy looked at her with very superior eyes.
“Because it’s not our kind of school, stupid. This is
the old kind of school that they had hundreds and
hundreds of years ago.” He added loftily,
pronouncing the word carefully, “Centuries ago.”
Margie was hurt. “Well, I don’t know what
kind of school they had all that time ago.” She read
the book over his shoulder for a while, then said,
“Anyway, they had a teacher.”

They had a teacher... It was a man.
The Fun They Had / 7

“Sure they had a teacher, but it wasn’t a regular
teacher. It was a man.”
“A man? How could a man be a teacher?”
“Well, he just told the boys and girls things and
gave them homework and asked them questions.”
7.
“A man isn’t smart enough.”
“Sure he is. My father knows as much as my
teacher.”
“He knows almost as much, I betcha.”
Margie wasn’t prepared to dispute that. She said,
“I wouldn’t want a strange man in my house to
teach me.”
Tommy screamed with laughter. “You don’t know
much, Margie. The teachers didn’t live in the
house. They had a special building and all the
kids went there.”
“And all the kids learned the same thing?”
“Sure, if they were the same age.”
8.
“But my mother says a teacher has to be adjusted
to fit the mind of each boy and girl it teaches and
that each kid has to be taught differently.”
“Just the same they didn’t do it that way then.
If you don’t like it, you don’t have to read the book.”
“I didn’t say I didn’t like it,” Margie said quickly.
She wanted to read about those funny schools.
They weren’t even half finished when Margie’s
mother called, “Margie! School!”
Margie looked up. “Not yet, Mamma.”
“Now!” said Mrs Jones. “And it’s probably time
for Tommy, too.”
Margie said to Tommy, “Can I read the book some
more with you after school?”
9.
“May be,” he said nonchalantly. He walked away
whistling, the dusty old book tucked beneath
his arm.
Margie went into the schoolroom. It was right
next to her bedroom, and the mechanical teacher
was on and waiting for her. It was always on at the
same time every day except Saturday and Sunday,

because her mother said little girls learned better
if they learned at regular hours.
The screen was lit up, and it said: “Today’s
arithmetic lesson is on the addition of proper
fractions. Please insert yesterday’s homework in the
proper slot.”
10.
Margie did so with a sigh. She was thinking about
the old schools they had when her grandfather’s
grandfather was a little boy. All the kids from the
whole neighborhood came, laughing and shouting
in the schoolyard, sitting together in the schoolroom,
going home together at the end of the day. They
learned the same things, so they could help one
another with the homework and talk about it.
And the teachers were people…
The mechanical teacher was flashing on the
screen: “When we add fractions ½ and ¼ ...”
Margie was thinking about how the kids must
have loved it in the old days. She was thinking
about the fun they had.

The Road Not Taken
This well-known poem is about making choices, and the
choices that shape us. Robert Frost is an American poet who
writes simply, but insightfully, about common, ordinary
experiences.

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveller, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same.
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

o
n

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence;
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I —
I took the one less travelled by,
And that has made all the difference.
