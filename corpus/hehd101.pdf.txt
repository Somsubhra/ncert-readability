General
Learning a language means using it for a wide variety of
purposes. Language is best acquired when attention is focused
on meaning, not on form.
Words and phrases not closely related to objects and action
remain empty and lifeless to young learners. Language comes
alive when presented in meaning-making contexts.
Words/phrases that are used to accomplish many useful
purposes follow a certain system inherent in the language itself.
Learners become familiar with the system through continuous
exposure to the language in meaning-focused situations.
Interaction, discussion and sharing of ideas among learners
provide opportunities that elicit ‘real’ information about them
and their experiences and opinions.
Encourage learners to work in pairs and small groups and let
them go beyond the textbook by providing a variety of
language inputs for spontaneous and natural use of language.
Build on the exercises given in the textbook and design more
tasks/activities in keeping with learners’ interests, needs and
surroundings. Employ free-response exercises (with more than
one possible response).
Promote reading habits through story reading (not merely
teaching stories as texts), story retelling, choral reading, shared
reading, etc.
Create class libraries for exchange of books and shared
reading. The library may also move with children to the next
higher class.
Poems need not be taught line by line, word by word. You may
give a model reading but let every child read the poem on her/his
own to feel the richness of language, rhythm and music of words.
Exercises accompanying the poem are more for understanding
the poem as a whole than for teaching language items.

Encourage learners to tell new stories, narrate anecdotes,
compose short poems in English or their own language, talk
about pictures, illustrations in the book and cartoons in
newspapers/magazines. Don’t get anxious about the errors they
will make. Constant exposure, practice and correction in the
form of feedback will help them improve themselves by and by.
Every page has a column for words and meanings. Encourage
children to write down other words they find difficult, along
with their meanings, in this column.

The Best Christmas Present in the World

Some suggestions given below are applicable to all prose lessons
in the book.
A war story against the backdrop of Christmas, a festival
marked by family reunion, exchange of presents and universal
bonhomie. Connie, aged 101, receives a present from a stranger
whom she mistakes for her long-awaited husband. What is
the present — the letter or the mistaken identity of the visitor?
Spend about 20 minutes discussing the dates and events given
under Before you read. Since the answers are given later in
the book, the focus should be on the nature of each event —
whether, in human terms, the event recalls defeat and
destruction or endeavour and success. Let children express
their own views. Even if their observations do not reveal any
understanding of the nature of events, the discussion session
will provide an excellent base for initiating work on the story
under reference.
The story is sectioned into three parts. Parts II and III may be
sectioned further according to convenience and time available.
Discuss each illustration with reference to the story.
Illustrations are given for better comprehension and sharper
visual appeal.
Comprehension Check at the end of each section is a recall of
what children have read so far. Design while-reading
comprehension exercises in the form of factual comprehension
questions, multiple choice questions and/or completion of
sentences, etc.

Here is one example in three formats:
Factual or inferential comprehension (Answer the question
in your own words.)
Why is Jim ‘ashamed to say’ that Fritz ‘began it’?
Multiple choice (Mark the right answer.)
Jim is ‘ashamed to say’ that Fritz ‘began it’ because
(i) he didn’t know how to do it.
(ii) he wishes he had done it first.
(iii) he didn’t want to do it.
Sentence completion : (Choose the right item and complete
the sentence.)
But it is true, _______________ that Fritz began it.
(much to my delight / shame / dismay)

A related item here is the use of ‘begin’ and ‘start’ in appropriate
contexts.
Use ‘begin’ or ‘start’ appropriately in the following sentences.
(i) What time do you _________ work in the morning?
(ii) If we want to get there, we should ___________ now.
(iii) The film ___________ at 7 pm.
(iv) No matter how you try, the car won’t ___________.
Very often ‘begin’ and ‘start’ can be used in the same way,
though ‘start’ is more common in informal speech. [See
sentences (i) and (iii)]
In some constructions only ‘start’ can be used. [See
sentences (ii) and (iv)].
Questions under working with the text to be answered orally,
later to be written in the copy book.
At the end of the lesson, draw children’s attention to the two
quotations given in the box. Let them discuss how the story
illustrates the same ideas. Then, ask them to find sentences in
the story which appeal to them most. Here are some examples:

o
n

We agreed about everything and he was my enemy.

No one dies in a football match. No children are orphaned.
No wives become widows.
I know from all that happened today how much both armies
long for peace. We shall be together again, I’m sure of it. (It’s
a good example of the use of ‘irony’ in the story.)

Notes for the Teacher

The Ant and the Cricket
Spend about 15 minutes eliciting, and listening to, fables or
fable-like stories from children, preferably in their own
language(s). Help them retell one or two in English by providing
appropriate words and phrases.
The story about the Sun and the Wind at the end of ‘Glimpses
of the Past’ may be used here. Ask them if it’s a fable, though
there are no animals in it.
Try the following writing task.
Rearrange the following sentences to construct a story. Start
with sentence 4.
1. One cold day, a hungry grasshopper came to the anthill
and begged for a little something to eat.
2. He replied, “Alas! I spent all my time singing and playing
and dancing, and never thought about winter.”
3. One ant asked him how he had spent his time during
summer and whether he had saved anything for winter.
4. A nest of ants had been occupied all through the summer
and autumn collecting food for winter.
5. They carefully stored it in the underground chambers of
their home.
6. Then we have nothing to give you.
7. Thus, when winter came, they had plenty to eat.
8. People who play and sing all summer should only dance
in winter.
9. The ant answered.

Find three adjectives in the first stanza associated with summer
and spring.
Find four phrases/lines in the same stanza associated with
the onset of winter.
Suppose the last line of the first stanza were to be rewritten as
‘Oh! What will become of me? Says the cricket.’ Would you
find it acceptable in the poem? If not, why not?
Speak the words given below. Ask children to write the word,
and against it two new words that rhyme.

·

sing ____________ ___________

· crumb ____________ ___________
· through ____________ ___________
· wished ____________ ___________
(Last sound in ‘crumb’ is ‘m’. In ‘wished’ it is ‘t’.)
Activity 4 under working with language needs patience and
time. Punctuation in writing sentences is an important teaching
point. Since the activity is to be taken up in groups, there will
be several versions of each sentence to begin with. Encourage
children to discuss why only one version is grammatically
acceptable and not the other.

A natural calamity causing huge destruction and loss of life
and property. Alongside the story of deep sorrow are reassuring
details of courage, survival and resilience.
While covering sections and sub sections of the text, focus on
situations in which children realise the importance of doing
whatever possible to save human and animal life, to participate
in relief work and to understand the concept of disaster
management.
Elicit their comments on, and reactions to, the stories of
Meghna and Almas. Focus on values such as courage, care
and compassion in the bitter struggle for survival and
rehabilitation.
The activity under Before you read is like an elementary
geography lesson. Map reading along with language work
(asking/answering questions, spotting location/ direction and
describing them with precision) is a good example of softening
subject boundaries and conforming to the idea of language
across the curriculum. Use other maps from the geography/
history textbook for further practice.
While dealing with ‘Active/Passive voice’ (working with
language: Activity 3), provide samples of texts exemplifying
the use of passive voice such as short newspaper reports and
descriptions of processes/experiments. As far as possible, avoid
a mechanical transformation exercise confined to isolated
sentences. Try a simple exercise given here.

Glimpses of the Past

‘Glimpses’ of the history of our country to be understood
through pictures with strips of text for support. Children have
a natural enthusiasm for this kind of material in the textbook.
Children may read the comic strip aloud. Then they break up
into small groups, discuss what they have read and write a
summary. Each group presents its summary one by one. The
whole class then enters into a general discussion, and a
consolidated draft of the composition is prepared with the active
support of the teacher.
Conversely, divide the class into small groups. Let each group
look at and describe a set of pictures (assigned to them) and
construct their own text. Texts thus produced can be put
together to form a coherent story, to be edited for accuracy.

Notes for the Teacher

If necessary, texts may first be produced in the child’s own
language and the teacher can help them to reformulate these
in English. For children fluent in English, this may be an
opportunity to formulate equivalent texts in their own
languages.
Some details of each ‘glimpse’ of the past may be had from the
history textbook of the same class. The history teacher may
be invited to facilitate the activity.
Picture reading under speaking and writing to be attempted
in the same manner.
Creating a comic (Activity 5) will be great fun if children can be
persuaded to draw/learn to draw matchstick figures. Enlist
the help of the art teacher.

Bepin Choudhury’s Lapse of Memory
A Satyajit Ray story with a surprise ending that brings in its wake
the much needed psychological relief to the sophisticated executive
beleagured by a conspiracy, which is a humorous take after all.
Before asking children to read the text, tell the story part by part,
each part ending where the listener wonders what comes next.
Activity 3 under working with language is about two tense
forms — simple past and present perfect. Notice how both
have been used in conjunction with each other. The following
explanatory notes may be useful.
• The present perfect tense is used to refer to an action
initiated and completed in the past and is associated with
the present. It has its effect on the present situation.
I have seen the Taj. (I know what it looks like.)
He has arrived. (He is here.)
I have finished my work. (I am free now.)
Present perfect tense is usual with already, so far,not yet, ever,
never etc.

The Last Bargain

Here is a method of teaching that may be tried.
(a) Let children read the first stanza silently.
Ask the following questions.
(i) How many persons/characters are there?
(ii) Who are they?
(iii) Who is big and who is small?
(iv) What does the person in the first line say?
(v) What does the other one in the fourth line say?
(vi) Do they stay together or part company? Why?

(b) Now reconstruct the episode. Begin like this.
I was walking on the road looking for work. I saw the king in
his chariot. He had a sword in his hand. He was very kind to
me. He shook my hand and offered to hire me. I did not
accept his offer. To me, power is not a valuable thing. It is not
permanent. It won’t make me happy. I was looking for
something else as a reward for my work.
What is he looking for?
Let us read the next stanza.
(c) Do the other stanzas in the same way.
The clue to what the person is looking for lies in the last line.
The operative phrases are ‘the child’s play’ and ‘a free man’.
The child and her/his play is a metaphor for innocence and inward
happiness, which gives this person a sense of fulfilment and
freedom from stress and strife. He feels genuinely free and happy
in the company of the child.
Recite each stanza with feeling, pausing at the right places.
The method suggested may work better for a poem with a story.

The Summit Within

Adventure and the world of nature – the arduous task of
reaching the highest summit in the world makes the climber
reflect on the ‘internal summits’ which are, perhaps, higher
than the Everest. The text underscores the physical, emotional
and spiritual aspects of the adventure in a single perspective.
Divide the text into three parts. A convenient division is
suggested here.
‘...............that mountains are a means of communion with
God’. (end of Part-I)
‘It is emotional. It is spiritual’. (end of Part-II)
The remaining is Part-III.

may try the following as additional questions.
What is the author’s personal answer to the question as to
why people climb mountains?
How is the same question answered in Part-II in a different way?

Famous climbers have recorded how they needed just that
help? Explain the italicised phrase.

(a) Complete this sentence using the same words as in the
text without referring to the book.
(b) Now complete it using a clause/phrase of your own
without changing meaning.
Activities 2 and 3 under working with language provide ample
opportunities for vocabulary development. Extend Activity 2
by choosing new words from the text to cover their adjective
and/or adverb forms.
remark – remarkable – remarkably
type – typical – typically
Use each item in a meaningful context, involving more than one
sentence.
‘What you say is not appropriate, though it’s a good remark.’
‘Isn’t that remarkable?’
‘It may be so, but it doesn’t mean you are remarkably objective.’
You may not find the dialogue above remarkable enough, but
it meets the immediate requirement appropriately.
Re-read and discuss passages where the author’s admiration
for the mountains and passion for adventure comes through.

ensue — a village school where children are sitting on the floor;
another school where they are sitting at long desks; an outdoor
lesson under a tree, etc.

bus, etc.? What problems others in remote areas may face in
reaching school on time?
Any suggestions as to how to make school an interesting and

This is Jody’s Fawn
A story about a child’s emotional preoccupation with the fawn
whose mother had to be killed to save his father’s life. The
story highlights values such as compassion and justice, care
and concern for human and animal life.
Spend some time on a discussion about ‘home remedies’ for
commonplace health problems/ailments. Should we see a
doctor about every little thing, or should we talk to the
grandmother first?
The growing concern about preservation of environment and
protection of animal life has gone a long way in persuading schools
to refrain from dissecting animals for experiment. Elicit children’s
comments on the issue and on the law that punishes humans
for hurting animals.

Activity 1 under working with language is about reporting
questions – yes/no and wh-questions. The use of ‘if/whether’
in the case of yes/no type questions should be explicitly
explained. Devise separate exercises for teaching the use of
‘if/whether’, the appropriate reporting verb, the changes in
pronominals in the reported speech and the sequence of tenses.
Here is a simple exercise to exemplify some of these points.
Choose the correct word to complete statements in indirect speech
given below. Write words in the blanks given.
(a) “Where do you come from?”
I ___________(said/asked) him where ______________ (he/
you) come from.
(b) “What is your name?”

(e) “Why are you crying?”
The teacher asked the child ______________ (if/why) she
_____ (is/was/were) crying.

Here is another exercise.
Read the following dialogue between Jody and his father. Rewrite
their conversation in indirect speech.
Penny lay quiet, staring at the ceiling.
“Boy, you’ve got me hemmed in.”
“It won’t take much to raise the fawn.
It will soon start eating leaves.”
“You are smarter than boys of your age.”
“We took its mother, and it wasn’t to blame.”
“It seems ungrateful to leave it to starve.”
Begin like this:
Penny lay quiet staring at the ceiling. He said to Jody that
______________________________________________. Jody replied
that it wouldn’t _________________________
Activity 2 under working with language deals with transitive
and intransitive verbs.
Ask children to underline the direct object in the following
sentences.
He brought me a colourful umbrella.
I will write a letter to him.
You should give yourself a chance.
Activity 3 under writing may be linked with the first task
covering home remedies under ‘Before you read,’ It will be

The Duck and the Kangaroo

Try the method suggested for The Last Bargain.

Before taking up the text and the activities given, let children
talk about ‘unusual’ activities they want to do such as walking
on the moon, floating in outer space or shaking hands with an
octopus. Take every idea seriously, no matter how improbable
it may seem. We may come upon enough raw material of which
The Duck and the Kangaroo is made.

o

It may be suggested that a story/poem like the present one
need not be factually correct or ‘real’. We enjoy reading them
because they appeal to our imagination, curiosity and sense
of the music of words.

Notes for the Teacher

Children should be encouraged to attempt short poems such
as the following.
1. Once I knew
A Kangaroo
Named Sue
How about you?
2. ‘There is a man
called Peter Pan’,
‘I know another
who’s neither Pan nor Peter.
You haven’t met him, have you?
It’s my friend Kanga Roo’.

Excerpt from a travelogue highlighting exchange of views
between two extraordinary persons on what it means to be
‘differently abled’. A tour through Cambridge had a surprise,
both pleasant and poignant, for the author. He met the brilliant
and completely paralysed author of A Brief History of Time,
and talked to him for a full half-hour.
Activity 2 under working with language is about the present
participle (dancing/walking) used as adjective.
Running on the road, he saw __________. (participle)
The train is running. __________ (verb)
The running train __________ (adjective)
The use of past participle as adjective may also be illustrated here.

Activity 3 under speaking and writing may be done as a project.
Lot of oral work to precede the writing task. The final draft should
be edited and improved before it is put up on the board.

Activities 1 and 2 under speaking and writing are about word
stress. Stressed syllables to be pronounced clearly and loudly.
Some words of more than one syllable from the text may also be
listed according to whether the stress falls on the first or the
second syllable.

When I Set Out for Lyonnesse
The poem has a clear beginning-middle-end structure. The
beginning is ‘setting out’, the middle is ‘sojourn’ and the end
is ‘return’.
Draw children’s attention to appropriate words/phrases/lines
that suggest and reinforce each phase of the journey.
‘Lyonnesse’ to be pronounced as lie-an-ness. The last syllable
receives the primary stress.
If feasible and useful, explain the rhyme scheme and its musical
effect on the listener.

This poem is relatively difficult. The difficulty lies in its brevity
of expression and complexity of thought.
The introductory note and activities under working with the
poem should be done elaborately adding additional
explanatory notes/tasks, wherever necessary.

The Great Stone Face – I and II

d
e

A classic piece of American fiction juxtaposing mellowness of
humanism with magnificence of art. Ernest, an unschooled
dweller of the valley, has close affinity with the ‘Stone Face’ atop
the hills beyond. Who resembles the splendid Stone Face — not
someone for all his wealth, not someone else for all his heroic
deeds, and not someone else yet again for his poetry and sublime
ideas. It is none other than Ernest who personifies a rare blend of
basic simplicity, practical wisdom and deep love for humanity.
The original story has been heavily abridged. Simplification
has been avoided in the interest of authenticity. You may like
to read the unabridged text for pleasure and edification.
Design three or four while-reading comprehension questions
for each section of the text (parts I and II)
The writing activity (Part-II : IV) is for further practice in language
analysis. Rearranging phrases to construct sentences and then
rearranging sentences to construct a paragraph will provide
many opportunities for thinking about cohesion and coherence.

I spotted it in a junk shop in Bridport, a roll-top desk.
The man said it was early nineteenth century, and oak.
I had wanted one, but they were far too expensive. This
one was in a bad condition, the roll-top in several pieces,
one leg clumsily mended, scorch marks all down one
side. It was going for very little money. I thought I could
restore it. It would be a risk, a challenge, but I had to
have it. I paid the man and brought it back to my
workroom at the back of the garage. I began work on it
on Christmas Eve.
I removed the roll-top completely and pulled out the
drawers. The veneer had lifted almost everywhere — it

looked like water damage to me. Both fire and water had
clearly taken their toll on this desk. The last drawer was
stuck fast. I tried all I could to ease it out gently. In the
end I used brute force. I struck it sharply with the side of
my fist and the drawer flew open to reveal a shallow space
underneath, a secret drawer. There was something in
there. I reached in and took out a small black tin box.
Sello-taped to the top of it was a piece of lined notepaper,
and written on it in shaky
handwriting: “Jim’s
last letter, received
January 25, 1915.
To be buried with
me when the
time comes.” I
knew as I did
it that it was
wrong of me to
open the box,
but curiosity
got the better of
my scruples. It
usually does.
Inside the box there was an envelope. The address
read: “Mrs Jim Macpherson, 12 Copper Beeches, Bridport,
Dorset.” I took out the letter and unfolded it. It was written
in pencil and dated at the top — “December 26, 1914”.

Dearest Connie,
I write to you in a much happier frame of mind because
something wonderful has just happened that I must tell

you about at once. We were all standing to in our trenches
yesterday morning, Christmas morning. It was crisp and
quiet all about, as beautiful a morning as I’ve ever seen, as
cold and frosty as a Christmas morning should be.
I should like to be able to tell you that we began it.
But the truth, I’m ashamed to say, is that Fritz began it.
First someone saw a white flag waving from the trenches
opposite. Then they were calling out to us from across
no man’s land, “Happy Christmas, Tommy! Happy
Christmas!” When we had got over the surprise, some of
us shouted back, “Same to you, Fritz! Same to you!” I
thought that would be that. We all did. But then suddenly
one of them was up there in his grey greatcoat and waving
a white flag. “Don’t shoot, lads!” someone shouted. And
no one did. Then there was another Fritz up on the
parapet, and another. “Keep your heads down,” I told the
men, “it’s a trick.” But it wasn’t.
One of the Germans was waving a bottle above his
head. “It is Christmas Day, Tommy. We have schnapps.
We have sausage. We meet you? Yes?” By this time there
were dozens of them walking towards us across no man’s
land and not a rifle between them. Little Private Morris
was the first up. “Come on, boys. What are we waiting
for?” And then there was no stopping them. I was the
officer. I should have stopped them there and then, I
suppose, but the truth is that it never even occurred to
me I should. All along their line and ours I could see
men walking slowly towards one another, grey coats,
khaki coats meeting in the middle. And I was one of
them. I was part of this. In the middle of the war we
were making peace.
You cannot imagine, dearest Connie, my feelings as
I looked into the eyes of the Fritz officer, who approached
me, hand outstretched. “Hans Wolf,” he said, gripping
my hand warmly and holding it. “I am from Dusseldorf.
I play the cello in the orchestra. Happy Christmas.”

“Captain Jim Macpherson,” I replied. “And a Happy
Christmas to you too. I’m a school teacher from Dorset,
in the west of England.”
“Ah, Dorset,” he smiled. “I know this place. I know it
very well.” We shared my rum ration and his excellent
sausage. And we talked, Connie, how we talked. He spoke
almost perfect English. But it turned out that he had
never set foot in Dorset, never even been to England.
He had learned all he knew of England from school,
and from reading books in English. His favourite writer
was Thomas Hardy, his favourite book Far from the
Madding Crowd. So out there in no man’s land we talked
of Bathsheba and Gabriel Oak and Sergeant Troy and
Dorset. He had a wife and one son, born just six months
ago. As I looked about me there were huddles of khaki
and grey everywhere, all over no man’s land, smoking,
laughing, talking, drinking, eating. Hans Wolf and I
shared what was left of your wonderful Christmas cake,
Connie. He thought the marzipan was the best he had
ever tasted. I agreed. We agreed about everything, and
he was my enemy. There never was a Christmas party
like it, Connie.
Then someone, I don’t know who, brought out a
football. Greatcoats were dumped in piles to make
goalposts, and the next thing we knew it was Tommy
against Fritz out in the middle of no man’s land. Hans
Wolf and I looked on and cheered, clapping our hands
and stamping our feet, to keep out the cold as much as
anything. There was a moment when I noticed our
breaths mingling in the air between us. He saw it too
and smiled. “Jim Macpherson,” he said after a while,
“I think this is how we should resolve this war. A football
match. No one dies in a football match. No children are
orphaned. No wives become widows.”
“I’d prefer cricket,” I told him. “Then we Tommies
could be sure of winning, probably.” We laughed at
that, and together we watched the game. Sad to say,

Connie, Fritz won, two goals to one. But as Hans Wolf
generously said, our goal was wider than theirs, so it
wasn’t quite fair.
The time came, and all too soon, when the game was
finished, the schnapps and the rum and the sausage
had long since run out, and we knew it was all over.
I wished Hans well and told him I hoped he would see
his family again soon, that the fighting would end and
we could all go home.
“I think that is what every soldier wants, on both
sides,” Hans Wolf said. “Take care, Jim Macpherson.
I shall never forget this moment, nor you.” He saluted
and walked away from me slowly, unwillingly, I felt.
He turned to wave just once and then became one of
the hundreds of grey-coated men drifting back towards
their trenches.
That night, back in our dugouts, we heard them
singing a carol, and singing it quite beautifully. It was
Stille Nacht, Silent Night. Our boys gave them a rousing
chorus of While Shepherds Watched. We exchanged
carols for a while and then we all fell silent. We had had
our time of peace and goodwill, a time I will treasure as
long as I live.

armies long for peace. We shall be together again soon,

I folded the letter again and slipped it carefully back
into its envelope. I kept awake all night. By morning I
knew what I had to do. I drove into Bridport, just a few
miles away. I asked a boy walking his dog where Copper
Beeches was. House number 12 turned out to be nothing
but a burned-out shell, the roof gaping, the windows
boarded-up. I knocked at the house next door and asked
if anyone knew the whereabouts of a Mrs Macpherson.
Oh yes, said the old man in his slippers, he knew her
well. A lovely old lady, he told me, a bit muddle-headed,
but at her age she was entitled to be, wasn’t she? A
hundred and one years old. She had been in the house
when it caught fire. No one really knew how the fire had
started, but it could well have been candles. She used
candles rather than electricity, because she always
thought electricity was too expensive. The fireman had
got her out just in time. She was in a nursing home
now, he told me, Burlington House, on the Dorchester
road, on the other side of town.

Comprehension Check
1. Why did the author go to Bridport?
2. How old was Mrs Macpherson now? Where was she?

I found Burlington House Nursing Home easily enough.
There were paper chains up in the hallway and a lighted
Christmas tree stood in the corner with a lopsided angel
on top. I said I was a friend come to visit Mrs Macpherson
to bring her a Christmas present. I could see through
into the dining room where everyone was wearing a paper
hat and singing. The matron had a hat on too and
seemed happy enough to see me. She even offered me a
mince pie. She walked me along the corridor.
“Mrs Macpherson is not in with the others,” she told
me. “She’s rather confused today so we thought it best
if she had a good rest. She has no family you know, no
one visits. So I’m sure she’ll be only too pleased to see
you.” She took me into a conservatory with wicker chairs
and potted plants all around and left me.
The old lady was sitting in a wheelchair, her hands
folded in her lap. She had silver white hair pinned into a
wispy bun. She was gazing out at
the garden. “Hello,” I said. She
turned and looked up at me
vacantly. “Happy Christmas,
Connie,” I went on. “I found
this. I think it’s yours.” As I was
speaking her eyes never left my
face. I opened the tin box and
gave it to her. That was the
moment her eyes lit up with
recognition and her face
became suffused with a sudden
glow of happiness. I explained
about the desk, about how I
had found it, but I don't think
she was listening. For a while

she said nothing, but stroked the letter tenderly with her
fingertips.
Suddenly she reached out and took my hand. Her
eyes were filled with tears. “You told me you’d come home
by Christmas, dearest,” she said. “And here you are,
the best Christmas present in the world. Come closer,
Jim dear, sit down.”
I sat down beside her, and she kissed my cheek. “I
read your letter so often Jim, every day. I wanted to
hear your voice in my head. It always made me feel you
were with me. And now you are. Now you’re back you
can read it to me yourself. Would you do that for me,
Jim dear? I just want to hear your voice again. I’d love
that so much. And then perhaps we’ll have some tea.
I’ve made you a nice Christmas cake, marzipan all
around. I know how much you love marzipan.”

1. Look at these sentences from the story.
I spotted it in a junk shop in Bridport... The man said it was made in
the early nineteenth century… This one was in bad condition…
The italicised verbs are in the past tense. They tell us what happened in
the past, before now.
(i) Read the passage below and underline the verbs in the past tense.
A man got on the train and sat down. The compartment was empty
except for one lady. She took her gloves off. A few hours later the
police arrested the man. They held him for 24 hours and then freed
him.
Now look at these sentences.
The veneer had lifted almost everywhere. Both fire and water had
taken their toll on this desk.
Notice the verb forms had lifted, had taken (their toll).
The author found and bought the desk in the past.
The desk was damaged before the author found it and bought it.
Fire and water had damaged the desk before the author found it
and bought it.
We use verb forms like had damaged for an event in the ‘earlier
past’. If there are two events in the past, we use the ‘had…’ form for
the event that occurred first in the past.
We also use the past perfect tense to show that something was
wished for, or expected before a particular time in the past. For
example, I had always wanted one…

2. Dictionary work
By the end of the journey, we had run out of drinking water.
Look at the verb run out of in this sentence. It is a phrasal verb: it has
two parts, a verb and a preposition or an adverb. Phrasal verbs often
have meanings that are different from the meanings of their parts.
Find these phrasal verbs in the story.

Write down the sentences in which they occur. Consult a dictionary and
write down the meaning that you think matches the meaning of the
phrasal verb in the sentence.

A fable is a story, often with animals as characters, that conveys
a moral. This poem about an ant and a cricket contains an idea
of far-reaching significance, which is as true of a four-legged
cricket as of a ‘two-legged one’. Surely, you have seen a cricket
that has two legs!

A silly young cricket, accustomed to sing
Through the warm, sunny months of gay summer and spring,
Began to complain when he found that, at home,
His cupboard was empty, and winter was come.
Not a crumb to be found
On the snow-covered ground;
Not a flower could he see,
Not a leaf on a tree.
“Oh! what will become,” says the cricket, “of me?”

At last by starvation and famine made bold,
All dripping with wet, and all trembling with cold,
Away he set off to a miserly ant,
To see if, to keep him alive, he would grant
Him shelter from rain,
And a mouthful of grain.
He wished only to borrow;
He’d repay it tomorrow;
If not, he must die of starvation and sorrow.

My heart was so light
That I sang day and night,
For all nature looked gay.”
“You sang, Sir, you say?
Go then,” says the ant, “and dance the winter away.”
Thus ending, he hastily lifted the wicket,
And out of the door turned the poor little cricket.
Folks call this a fable. I’ll warrant it true:
Some crickets have four legs, and some have two.
