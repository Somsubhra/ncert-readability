The National Curriculum Framework, 2005, recommends
that children's life at school must be linked to their life outside
the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy
of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and
causes a gap between the school, home and community. The
syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify
an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to
discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these
measures will take us significantly further in the direction of
a child-centred system of education outlined in the National
Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school
principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect
on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and
questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and
freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with
the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the
prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of
the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are
ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we
perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as
receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines
and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is
as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar
so that the required number of teaching days are actually
devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and
evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook
proves for making children's life at school a happy experience,
rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers
have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by
restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages
with greater consideration for child psychology and the time
available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this
endeavour by giving higher priority and space to

opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion
in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and
Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the
Textbook Development Committee responsible for this book.
We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in
Languages, Professor Namwar Singh and the Chief Advisor
for this book, Professor Amritavalli for guiding the work of
this committee. Several teachers contributed to the
development of this textbook; we are grateful to their
principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the
institutions and organisations which have generously
permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and
personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the
National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department
of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human
Resource Development under the Chairmanship of
Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their
valuable time and contribution. As an organisation committed
to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality
of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions
which will enable us to undertake further revision and
refinement.

This textbook for Class XII English course has been developed
on the basis of the recommendations made in the National
Curriculum Framework 2005. It follows the design of the
Class XI textbook, Hornbill, published in 2006.
The prose selections aim to provide exposure to a wide
variety of genres and themes, and writing from different parts
of the world. They take into account the interests of young
adults while making them aware of the socio-political issues
that they will confront as they step into the world outside
school. The tasks that follow the units provide opportunities
for the development of language skills.
Three short stories, representative of fiction from different
parts of the world - French, Swedish and British, have been
included. Alphonse Daudet’s The Last Lesson deals with
the theme of language imposition and language loyalty,
Selma Lagelerof’s The Rattrap, captures the basic goodness
in a human being in the face of material temptations and
A.C. Barton’s Going Places explores the theme of adolescent
hero-worship and fantasising.
Two of the non-fiction pieces are biographical and two
autobiographical. Of the two biographical pieces, Indigo, an
excerpt from Louis Fischer’s Life of Mahatma Gandhi
portrays Gandhi in action, helping peasants secure legal
justice and the excerpt from Anees Jung’s Lost Spring is an
account of the lives of street children, a contemporary reality
that youngsters need to be made sensitive to.
The autobiographical piece by William Douglas, a lawyer
who was a close associate of Franklin Roosevelt, deals with
his personal experience of overcoming the fear of swimming.
The second autobiographical account is by Asokamitran
writing in a humorous vein about his years in the Gemini
Studios.
The Introduction from The Penguin Book of Interviews
edited by Christopher Silvester has been included to
introduce pupils to the subject of media writing. This is
accompanied by a recent newspaper interview with Umberto
Eco by Mukund Padmanabhan.

Each Unit is interspersed with ‘Think as you read’
questions to check factual comprehension. This is followed
by end-of-unit global questions and text-related issues to
be taken up for discussion. Language work on vocabulary
and sentence patterns is followed by writing tasks. Useful
vocabulary is presented at the beginning of each unit for
learners to notice them in the text and understand their
meaning from the context. Annotations are added where
necessary. ‘About the unit’ highlights the points of focus in
the tasks section following each text.
The poetry section has six poems. A short excerpt from
Keats’ Endymion has been chosen to give pupils a taste of
classical poetry, lines which have universal appeal and eternal
value. Robert Frost’s A Roadside Stand is on the rural-urban
economic divide. The other four poems are by reputed
contemporary poets including two women, Kamala Das and
Adrienne Rich. While the theme of Das’ poem, My Mother at
Sixty-six touches a personal chord of looking objectively at a
close relative, Rich’s poem, Aunt Jennifer’s Tigers, gives
expression to the voice of women stifled by the institution of
marriage. Stephen Spender’s poem on An Elementary School
Classroom in a Slum sensitively brings out the disparity
between the formal education system and the reality of the
lives of the poor. The poems are followed by ‘noticing’ items
which indicate the elements that deserve special attention in
the classroom.
The tasks in the poetry section encourage pupils to enjoy
aesthetic writing and evoke subjective responses to the
language of poetry.
