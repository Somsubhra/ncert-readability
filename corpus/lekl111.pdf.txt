A poem is a composition in verse, usually
characterised by concentrated and
heightened language in which words are
chosen for their sound and suggestive power
as well as for their meaning, and using
techniques such as rhythm and metre. To
read and hear good poetry is to appreciate the
subtleties of cadence and rhythm, the variety
of pace and pattern and all that goes to make
up the music of poetry.
Every poem that we read adds to, in some
degree, our total conception of poetry.

Of the eight poets in this selection, four are
from the classical tradition: Donne, Milton,
Blake and Coleridge. The other four are
closer to contemporary times: Yeats,
A.K.Ramanujan, Emily Dickinson and
Kamala Das.

A Lecture Upon the Shadow

John Donne was representative of the
metaphysical poets of his time. He set the
metaphysical mode by vibrancy of language
and startling imagery, and a preference for
a diction modelled on direct utterances. He
was brought up as a Roman Catholic (later
he converted to Anglicanism), and was Dean
of St. Paul’s Church till his death.
The total effect of a metaphysical poem at its
best is to startle the reader into seeing and
knowing what he has not really noticed or
thought about before. Like all Donne’s poetry
this poem too reflects an emphasis on the
intellect and wit as against feeling and
emotion.

John Donne
1572-1631

Stand still and I will read to thee
A Lecture, Love, in loves philosophy,
These three houres that we have spent,
Walking here, Two shadowes went
Along with us, which we our selves produc’d;
But, now the Sunne is just above our head,
We doe those shadowes tread;
And to brave clearnesse all things are reduc’d.
So whilst our infant loves did grow,
Disguises did, and shadowes, flow,
From us, and our cares; but now ’tis not so.
That love hath not attain’d the high’st degree,
Which is still diligent lest others see.
Except our loves at this noone stay,

d

We shall new shadowes make the other way.
As the first were made to blinde
Others; these which come behinde
Will worke upon our selves, and blind our eyes.
If our loves faint, and westwardly decline;

And his first minute, after noone, is night.

John Milton began writing poetry at the age of
ten. After finishing his formal education at
Cambridge, he read almost everything available
in Latin, Greek, Italian and English. He was
appointed Latin Secretary where he worked
so hard that eyestrain, from years of late night
reading, caused him to become totally blind at
the age of forty- five. In the final years of his
life he wrote (through dictation) Paradise Lost
and Paradise Regained.

Fly envious Time, till thou run out thy race,
Call on the lazy leaden-stepping hours,
Whose speed is but the heavy Plummets pace;
And glut thy self with what thy womb devours,
Which is no more than what is false and vain,
And merely mortal dross;
So little is our loss,
So little is thy gain.
For when as each thing bad thou hast entomb’d,
And last of all, thy greedy self consum’d,
Then long Eternity shall greet our bliss
With an individual kiss;
And Joy shall overtake us as a flood,
When every thing that is sincerely good
And perfectly divine,
With Truth, and Peace, and Love shall ever shine

95/POEMS BY MILTON

About the supreme Throne
Of him, t’whose happy-making sight alone,
When once our heav’nly guided soul shall clime,
Then all this Earthy grossnes quit,
Attir’d with Stars, we shall for ever sit,
Triumphing over Death, and Chance, and thee O Time.

Language Study

Etymology is the study of the history of linguistic change. When
applied to individual words, it is an account of (i) the history of
a word (ii) the derivation of a word.
The dictionary meaning of a word is followed by notes on its
origin.
For the word ‘entomb’d’ the information we get is: [late ME
entoumbe(n) MF entombe(r)]. This means that
• The word is found in late Middle English

• The word is of French origin and is found in use from 1578
• Also, about 30 per cent of the words in English are of French
origin. Borrowings from French reached its height after the
Norman Conquest (1066)—between 1250 and 1400.

William Blake
1757-1827

William Blake was a poet, painter and engraver.
He abhorred the rationalism and materialism of
his times. What he saw and painted were human
beings beset with evil, yet striving for the divine
within them.
Blake’s lyrics appeared in two sets of volumes:
Songs of Innocence (from which The Divine Image
has been chosen) and Songs of Experience (from
which The Human Abstract has been taken)
representing the two contrary states of the human
soul. Most of the poems in the first volume have
counterparts in the second.

I
The Divine Image

To Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love
All pray in their distress;
And to these virtues of delight
Return their thankfulness.

o
n

For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love
Is God our father dear,
And Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love
Is Man, his child and care.

For Mercy has a human heart,
Pity a human face,
And Love, the human form divine,
And Peace, the human dress.

Then every man, of every clime,
That prays in his distress,
Prays to the human form divine,
Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.
And all must love the human form,
In heathen, turk, or jew;
Where Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell
There God is dwelling too.

The Human Abstract

Pity would be no more
If we did not make somebody Poor;
And Mercy no more could be
If all were as happy as we.
And mutual fear brings peace,
Till the selfish loves increase:
Then Cruelty knits a snare,
And spreads his baits with care.

He sits down with holy fears,
And waters the ground with tears;
Then Humility takes its root
Underneath his foot.

o

Soon spreads the dismal shade
Of Mystery over his head;
And the Caterpillar and Fly
Feed on the Mystery.

And it bears the fruit of Deceit,
Ruddy and sweet to eat;
And the Raven his nest has made
In its thickest shade.

The Gods of the earth and sea
Sought thro’ Nature to find this Tree;
But their search was all in vain:
There grows one in the Human Brain.
Note: Blake’s poetry was published in a manner most unusual in
literature and art history; he personally manufactured each
copy. The verses were not typeset but were, with the engravings
that illustrated them, cut into copper plates. The pages
themselves he illuminated in water colours. Thus Blake can
be called the first multi-media artist.

Innocence and how is he/she depicted in the Song of Experience?

rescued. Explain with reference to these two poems.

Or
A Vision in a Dream: A Fragment
S.T. Coleridge was imaginative even as a child.
He studied at Cambridge. In 1797, he met
Wordsworth; the two belonged to the first
generation of Romantic poets. Coleridge was
responsible for presenting the supernatural as
real and Wordsworth would try to render
ordinary reality as remarkable and strange.
Byron, Shelley and Keats belonged to the next
generation of Romantic Poets.
The genesis of this poem was a vision seen by
Coleridge in a trance-like state of mind. He tried
to capture its essence but an interruption caused
an irreparable break in his poetic flow.

S.T.Coleridge
1772-1834

In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure-dome decree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man
Down to a sunless sea.
So twice five miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were girdled round:
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,

* Kubla Khan founded the Mongol dynasty in China in the thirteenth century.
* You will notice that this poem is incomplete. Ther e is a reason behind this. In 1797, when
Coleridge fell ill, some medicine was prescribed, from the effects of which he fell asleep in
his chair while reading about Kubla Khan. In the three hours of profound sleep, he had a
wonderful dream. On awakening he distinctly recollected it, and began to write it down,
when he was interrupted by a chance visitor. The poem thus remained incomplete.

104/ KALEIDOSCOPE

Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
And here were forests ancient as the hills,
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
A savage place! as holy and enchanted
As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted
By woman wailing for her demon-lover!
And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
A mighty fountain momently was forced;
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail:
And ’mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
It flung up momently the sacred river.
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,
Then reached the caverns measureless to man,
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
Ancestral voices prophesying war!
The shadow of the dome of pleasure
Floated midway on the waves;
Where was heard the mingled measure
From the fountain and the caves.
It was a miracle of rare device,
A sunny pleasure dome with caves of ice!

And close your eyes with holy dread,
For he on honeydew hath fed,

Emily Dickinson
1830-1886

Emily Dickinson is regarded as one of
America’s quintessential poets of the nineteenth
century. She lived an introverted and hermetic
life, and published very few of her poems in
her lifetime. Her output, 1789 poems in all, were
published posthumously.
Her poetry is characterised by unconventional
capitalisation and extensive use of dashes,
along with unusual imagery and lyric style.

The Trees like Tassels hit – and – swung –
There seemed to rise a Tune
From Miniature Creatures
Accompanying the Sun –
Far Psalteries of Summer –
Enamoring the Ear
They never yet did satisfy –
Remotest – when most fair

o

The Sun shone whole at intervals –

And had Estates of Cloud
Sufficient to enfold Him

Except it were a whim of His
To let the Orchards grow –
