It is the time of the World War. An American prisoner of
war is washed ashore in a dying state and is found at the
doorstep of a Japanese doctor. Should he save him as a doctor
or hand him over to the Army as a patriot?

Dr Sadao Hoki’s house was built on a
spot of the Japanese coast where as a
little boy he had often played. The low,
square stone house was set upon rocks
well above a narrow beach that was
outlined with bent pines. As a boy Sadao

climbed for coconuts. His father had
taken him often to the islands of those
seas, and never had he failed to say to the little brave boy
at his side, ‘‘Those islands yonder, they are the stepping
stones to the future for Japan.’’
‘‘Where shall we step from them?’’ Sadao had asked
seriously.
‘‘Who knows?’’ his father had answered. ‘‘Who can limit
our future? It depends on what we make it.’’

Sadao had taken this into his mind as he did
everything his father said, his father who never joked or
played with him but who spent infinite pains upon him
who was his only son. Sadao knew that his education was
his father’s chief concern. For this reason he had been
sent at twenty-two to America to learn all that could be
learned of surgery and medicine. He had come back at
thirty, and before his father died he had seen Sadao become
famous not only as a surgeon but as a scientist. Because
he was perfecting a discovery which would render wounds
entirely clean, he had not been sent abroad with the troops.
Also, he knew, there was some slight danger that the old
General might need an operation for a condition for which
he was now being treated medically, and for this possibility
Sadao was being kept in Japan.
Clouds were rising from the ocean now. The unexpected
warmth of the past few days had at night drawn heavy fog
from the cold waves. Sadao watched mists hide outlines of
a little island near the shore and then come creeping up
the beach below the house, wreathing around the pines.
In a few minutes fog would be wrapped about the house
too. Then he would go into the room where Hana, his wife,
would be waiting for him with the two children.
But at this moment the door opened and she looked
out, a dark-blue woollen haori1 over her kimono. She came
to him affectionately and put her arm through his as he
stood, smiled and said nothing. He had met Hana in
America, but he had waited to fall in love with her until he
was sure she was Japanese. His father would never have
received her unless she had been pure in her race. He
wondered often whom he would have married if he had not
met Hana, and by what luck he had found her in the most
casual way, by chance literally, at an American professor’s
house. The professor and his wife had been kind people
anxious to do something for their few foreign students,
and the students, though bored, had accepted this
kindness. Sadao had often told Hana how nearly he had
not gone to Professor Harley’s house that night — the rooms

were so small, the food so bad, the professor’s wife so
voluble. But he had gone and there he had found Hana, a
new student, and had felt he would love her if it were at
all possible.
Now he felt her hand on his arm and was aware of the
pleasure it gave him, even though they had been married
years enough to have the two children. For they had not
married heedlessly in America. They had finished their work
at school and had come home to Japan, and when his
father had seen her the marriage had been arranged in
the old Japanese way, although Sadao and Hana had talked
everything over beforehand. They were perfectly happy. She
laid her cheek against his arm.
It was at this moment that

saw
something black come out
of the mists. It was a man.
He was flung up out of the
ocean — flung, it
seemed, to his feet by a
breaker. He staggered a
few steps, his body
outlined against the mist,
his arms above his head.
Then the curled mists hid
him again.
‘‘Who is that?’’ Hana
cried. She dropped Sadao’s
arm and they both leaned
over the railing of the
veranda. Now they
saw him again. The
man was on his
hands and knees
crawling. Then they saw him
fall on his face and lie there.
‘‘A fisherman perhaps,’’ Sadao
said, ‘‘washed from his boat.’’ He ran
quickly down the steps and behind him

Hana came, her wide sleeves flying. A mile or two away on
either side there were fishing villages, but here was only
the bare and lonely coast, dangerous with rocks. The surf
beyond the beach was spiked with rocks. Somehow the
man had managed to come through them — he must be
badly torn.
They saw when they came toward him that indeed it
was so. The sand on one side of him had already a stain of
red soaking through.
‘‘He is wounded,’’ Sadao exclaimed. He made haste to
the man, who lay motionless, his face in the sand. An old
cap stuck to his head soaked with sea water. He was in
wet rags of garments. Sadao stopped, Hana at his side,
and turned the man’s head. They saw the face.
“A white man!” Hana whispered.
Yes, it was a white man. The wet cap fell away and
there was his wet yellow hair, long, as though for many
weeks it had not been cut, and upon his young and tortured
face was a rough yellow beard. He was
unconscious and knew nothing that they
did for him.
Now Sadao remembered the wound,
and with his expert fingers he began to
search for it. Blood flowed freshly at his
touch. On the right side of his lower back

the man had been shot and had not been
tended. It was bad chance that the rock
had struck the wound.
‘‘Oh, how he is bleeding!’’ Hana whispered again in a
solemn voice. The mists screened them now completely,
and at this time of day no one came by. The fishermen had
gone home and even the chance beachcombers would have
considered the day at an end.
‘‘What shall we do with this man?’’ Sadao muttered.
But his trained hands seemed of their own will to be doing
what they could to stanch the fearful bleeding. He packed

the wound with the sea moss that strewed the beach. The
man moaned with pain in his stupor but he did not awaken.
‘‘The best thing that we could do would be to put him
back in the sea,’’ Sadao said, answering himself.
Now that the bleeding was stopped for the moment he
stood up and dusted the sand from his hands.
‘‘Yes, undoubtedly that would be best,’’ Hana said
steadily. But she continued to stare down at the motionless
man.
‘‘If we sheltered a white man in our house we should
be arrested and if we turned him over as a prisoner, he
would certainly die,’’ Sadao said.
‘‘The kindest thing would be to put him back into the
sea,’’ Hana said. But neither of them moved. They were
staring with a curious repulsion upon the inert figure.
‘‘What is he?’’ Hana whispered.
‘‘There is something about him that looks American,’’
Sadao said. He took up the battered cap. Yes, there, almost
gone, was the faint lettering. ‘‘A sailor,’’ he said, ‘‘from an
American warship.’’ He spelled it out: ‘‘U.S. Navy.’’ The man
was a prisoner of war!
‘‘He has escaped.’’ Hana cried softly, ‘‘and that is why
he is wounded.’’
‘‘In the back,’’ Sadao agreed.
They hesitated, looking at each other. Then Hana said
with resolution:
“Come, are we able to put him back into the sea?”
“If I am able, are you?” Sadao asked.
“No,” Hana said, “But if you can do it alone...”
Sadao hesitated again. “The strange thing is,” he said,
“that if the man were whole I could turn him over to the
police without difficulty. I care nothing for him. He is my
enemy. All Americans are my enemy. And he is only a
common fellow. You see how foolish his face is. But since
he is wounded…”
“You also cannot throw him back to the sea,” Hana
said. “Then there is only one thing to do. We must carry
him into the house.”
“But the servants?” Sadao inquired.

“We must simply tell them that we intend to give him
to the police — as indeed we must, Sadao. We must think
of the children and your position. It would endanger all of
us if we did not give this man over as a prisoner of war.”
“Certainly,” Sadao agreed. “I would not think of doing
anything else.”
Thus agreed, together they lifted the man. He was very
light, like a fowl that had been half-starved for a long time
until it is only feathers and skeleton. So, his arms hanging,
they carried him up the steps and into the side door of the
house. This door opened into a passage, and down the
passage they carried the man towards an empty bedroom.
It had been the bedroom of Sadao’s father, and since his
death it had not been used. They laid the man on the
deeply matted floor. Everything here had been Japanese to
please the old man, who would never in his own home sit
on a chair or sleep in a foreign bed. Hana went to the wall
cupboards and slid back a door and took out a soft quilt.
She hesitated. The quilt was covered with flowered silk and
the lining was pure white silk.
“He is so dirty,” she murmured in distress.
“Yes, he had better be washed,” Sadao agreed. “If you
will fetch hot water I will wash him.”
“I cannot bear for you to touch him,” she said. “We
shall have to tell the servants he is here. I will tell Yumi
now. She can leave the children for a few minutes and she
can wash him.”
Sadao considered a moment. “Let it be so,” he agreed.
“You tell Yumi and I will tell the others.”
But the utter pallor of the man’s unconscious face
moved him first to stoop and feel his pulse. It was faint but
it was there. He put his hand against the man’s cold breast.
The heart too was yet alive.
“He will die unless he is operated on,” Sadao said,
considering. “The question is whether he will not die
anyway.”
Hana cried out in fear. “Don’t try to save him! What if
he should live?”
“What if he should die?” Sadao replied. He stood gazing

down on the motionless man. This man must have
extraordinary vitality or he would have been dead by now.
But then he was very young — perhaps not yet twentyfive.
“You mean die from the operation?”
Hana asked.
“Yes,” Sadao said.
Hana considered this doubtfully, and when she did
not answer Sadao turned away. “At any rate something
must be done with him,” he said, “and first he must be
washed.” He went quickly out of the room and Hana came
behind him. She did not wish to be left alone with the
white man. He was the first she had seen since she left
America and now he seemed to have nothing to do with
those whom she had known there. Here he was her enemy,
a menace, living or dead.
She turned to the nursery and called, “Yumi!”
But the children heard her voice and she had to go in
for a moment and smile at them and play with the baby
boy, now nearly three months old.
Over the baby’s soft black hair she motioned with her
mouth, “Yumi — come with me!”
“I will put the baby to bed,” Yumi replied. “He is ready.”
She went with Yumi into the bedroom next to the
nursery and stood with the boy in her arms while Yumi
spread the sleeping quilts on the floor and laid the baby
between them.
Then Hana led the way quickly and softly to the
kitchen. The two servants were frightened at what their
master had just told them. The old gardener, who was also
a house servant, pulled the few hairs on his upper lip.
“The master ought not to heal the wound of this white
man,” he said bluntly to Hana. “The white man ought to
die. First he was shot. Then the sea caught him and
wounded him with her rocks. If the master heals what the
gun did and what the sea did they will take revenge on us.”
“I will tell him what you say,” Hana replied courteously.
But she herself was also frightened, although she was not
superstitious as the old man was. Could it ever be well to

help an enemy? Nevertheless she told Yumi to fetch the
hot water and bring it to the room where the white man
was.
She went ahead and slid back the partitions. Sadao
was not yet there. Yumi, following, put down her wooden
bucket. Then she went over to the white man. When she
saw him her thick lips folded themselves into stubbornness.
“I have never washed a white man,” she said, “and I will
not wash so dirty a one now.”
Hana cried at her severely. “You will do what your
master commands you!”
There was so fierce a look of resistance upon Yumi’s
round dull face that Hana felt unreasonably afraid. After
all, if the servants should report something that was not
as it happened?
“Very well,” she said with dignity. “You understand we
only want to bring him to his senses so that we can turn
him over as a prisoner?”
“I will have nothing to do with it,” Yumi said, “I am a
poor person and it is not my business.”
“Then please,” Hana said gently, “return to your own
work.”
At once Yumi left the room. But this left Hana with
the white man alone. She might have been too afraid to
stay had not her anger at Yumi’s stubbornness now
sustained her.
“Stupid Yumi,” she muttered
fiercely. “Is this anything but a man?
And a wounded helpless man!”
In the conviction of her own
superiority she bent impulsively and
untied the knotted rugs that kept the

steaming hot water and washed his face
carefully. The man’s skin, though rough
with exposure, was of a fine texture and must have been
very blond when he was a child.

While she was thinking these thoughts, though not
really liking the man better now that he was no longer a
child, she kept on washing him until his upper body was
quite clean. But she dared not turn him over. Where was
Sadao? Now her anger was ebbing, and she was anxious
again and she rose, wiping her hands on the wrong towel.
Then lest the man be chilled, she put the quilt over him.
“Sadao!” she called softly.
He had been about to come in when she called. His
hand had been on the door and now he opened it. She saw
that he had brought his surgeon’s emergency bag and that
he wore his surgeon’s coat.
“You have decided to operate!” she cried.
“Yes,” he said shortly. He turned his back to her and
unfolded a sterilized towel upon the floor of the tokonoma2
alcove, and put his instruments out upon it.
“Fetch towels,” he said.
She went obediently, but how anxious now, to the linen
shelves and took out the towels. There ought a0lso to be
old pieces of matting so that the blood would not ruin the
fine floor covering. She went out to the back veranda where
the gardener kept strips of matting with which to protect
delicate shrubs on cold nights and took an armful of them.
But when she went back into the room, she saw this was
useless. The blood had already soaked through the packing in
the man’s wound and had ruined the mat under him.
“Oh, the mat!” she cried.
“Yes, it is ruined,” Sadao replied, as though he did not
care. “Help me to turn him,” he commanded her.
She obeyed him without a word, and he began to wash
the man’s back carefully.
“Yumi would not wash him,” she said.
“Did you wash him then?” Sadao asked, not stopping
for a moment his swift concise movements.
“Yes,” she said.
He did not seem to hear her. But she was used to his
absorption when he was at work. She wondered for a

moment if it mattered to him what was the body upon
which he worked so long as it was for the work he did so
excellently.
“You will have to give the anesthetic if he needs it,” he
said.
“I?” she repeated blankly. “But never have I!”
“It is easy enough,” he said impatiently.
He was taking out the packing now, and the blood
began to flow more quickly. He peered into the wound with
the bright surgeon’s light fastened on his forehead. “The
bullet is still there,” he said with
cool interest. “Now I wonder
how deep this rock wound is.
If it is not too deep it may
be that I can get the bullet.
But the bleeding is not
superficial. He has
lost much blood.”

At this moment
Hana choked. He
looked up and saw her face the colour of sulphur.
“Don’t faint,” he said sharply. He did not put down his
exploring instrument. “If I stop now the man will surely
die.” She clapped her hands to her mouth and leaped up
and ran out of the room. Outside in the garden he heard
her retching. But he went on with his work.
“It will be better for her to empty her stomach,” he
thought. He had forgotten that of course she had never
seen an operation. But her distress and his inability to go
to her at once made him impatient and irritable with this
man who lay like dead under his knife.

“This man.” he thought, “there is no reason under
heaven why he should live.”
Unconsciously this thought made him ruthless and
he proceeded swiftly. In his dream the man moaned but
Sadao paid no heed except to mutter at him.
“Groan,” he muttered, “groan if you like. I am not doing
this for my own pleasure. In fact, I do not know why I am
doing it.”
The door opened and there was Hana again.
“Where is the anesthetic?” she asked in a clear voice.
Sadao motioned with his chin. “It is as well that you
came back,” he said. “This fellow is beginning to stir.”
She had the bottle and some cotton in her hand.
“But how shall I do it?” she asked.
“Simply saturate the cotton and hold it near his
nostrils,” Sadao replied without delaying for one moment
the intricate detail of his work. “When he breathes badly
move it away a little.”
She crouched close to the sleeping face of the young
American. It was a piteously thin face, she thought, and
the lips were twisted. The man was suffering whether he
knew it or not. Watching him, she wondered if the stories
they heard sometimes of the sufferings of prisoners were
true. They came like flickers of rumour, told by word of
mouth and always contradicted. In the newspapers the
reports were always that wherever the Japanese armies
went the people received them gladly, with cries of joy at
their liberation. But sometimes she remembered such men
as General Takima, who at home beat his wife cruelly,
though no one mentioned it now that he had fought so
victorious a battle in Manchuria. If a man like that could
be so cruel to a woman in his power, would he not be cruel
to one like this for instance?
She hoped anxiously that this young man had not been
tortured. It was at this moment that she observed deep red
scars on his neck, just under the ear.
“Those scars,” she murmured, lifting her eyes to Sadao.
But he did not answer. At this moment he felt the tip of
his instrument strike against something hard, dangerously

near the kidney. All thought left him. He felt only the purest
pleasure. He probed with his fingers, delicately, familiar
with every atom of this human body. His old American
professor of anatomy had seen to that knowledge. “Ignorance
of the human body is the surgeon’s cardinal sin, sirs!” he
had thundered at his classes year after year. “To operate
without as complete knowledge of the body as if you had
made it — anything less than that is murder.”
“It is not quite at the kidney, my friend,” Sadao
murmured. It was his habit to murmur to the patient when
he forgot himself in an operation. “My friend,” he always
called his patients and so now he did, forgetting that this
was his enemy.
Then quickly, with the cleanest and most precise of
incisions, the bullet was out. The man quivered but he
was still unconscious. Nevertheless he muttered a few
English words.
“Guts,” he muttered, choking. “They got...my guts...”
“Sadao!” Hana cried sharply.
“Hush,” Sadao said.
The man sank again into silence so profound that Sadao
took up his wrist, hating the touch of it. Yes, there was
still a pulse so faint, so feeble, but enough, if he wanted
the man to live, to give hope.
“But certainly I do not want this man to live,” he
thought.
“No more anesthetic,” he told Hana.
He turned as swiftly as though he had never paused
and from his medicines he chose a small vial and from it
filled a hypodermic and thrust it into
the patient’s left arm. Then putting
down the needle, he took the man’s wrist
again. The pulse under his fingers
fluttered once or twice and then grew
stronger.

where he was, that Hana felt compelled to apologise. She
herself served him, for none of the servants would enter the
room.
When she came in the first time, she saw him summon
his small strength to be prepared for some fearful thing.
“Don’t be afraid,” she begged him softly.
“How come... you speak English…” he gasped.
“I was a long time in America,” she replied.
She saw that he wanted to reply to that but he could
not, and so she knelt and fed him gently from the porcelain
spoon. He ate unwillingly, but still he ate.
“Now you will soon be strong,” she said, not liking him
and yet moved to comfort him.
He did not answer.
When Sadao came in the third day after the operation,
he found the young man sitting up, his face bloodless with
the effort.
“Lie down,” Sadao cried. “Do you want to die?”
He forced the man down gently and strongly and
examined the wound. “You may kill yourself if you do this
sort of thing,” he scolded.
“What are you going to do with me?” the boy muttered.
He looked just now barely seventeen. “Are you going to hand
me over?”
For a moment Sadao did not answer. He finished his
examination and then pulled the silk quilt over the man.
“I do not know myself what I shall do with you,” he
said. “I ought of course to give you to the police. You are a
prisoner of war — no, do not tell me anything.” He put up
his hand as he saw the young man was about to speak.
“Do not even tell me your name unless I ask it.”
They looked at each other for a moment, and then the
young man closed his eyes and turned his face to the wall.
“Okay,” he whispered, his mouth a bitter line.
Outside the door Hana was waiting for Sadao. He saw
at once that she was in trouble.
“Sadao, Yumi tells me the servants feel they cannot
stay if we hide this man here any more,” she said. “She
tells me that they are saying that you and I were so long in

America that we have forgotten to think of our own country
first. They think we like Americans.”
“It is not true,” Sadao said harshly “Americans are
our enemies. But I have been trained not to let a man die
if I can help it.”
“The servants cannot understand that,” she said
anxiously.
“No,” he agreed.
Neither seemed able to say more, and somehow the
household dragged on. The servants grew more watchful.
Their courtesy was as careful as ever, but their eyes were
cold upon the pair to whom they were hired.
“It is clear what our master ought to do,” the old
gardener said one morning. He had worked with flowers
all his life, and had been a specialist too in moss. For
Sadao’s father he had made one of the finest moss gardens
in Japan, sweeping the bright green carpet constantly so
that not a leaf or a pine needle marred the velvet of its
surface. “My old master’s son knows very well what he
ought to do,” he now said, pinching a bud from a bush as
he spoke. “When the man was so near death why did he
not let him bleed?”
“That young master is so proud of his skill to save life
that he saves any life,” the cook said contemptuously. She
split a fowl’s neck skillfully and held the fluttering bird and
let its blood flow into the roots of a wistaria vine. Blood is
the best of fertilisers, and the old gardener would not let
her waste a drop of it.
“It is the children of whom we must think,” Yumi said
sadly. “What will be their fate if their father is condemned
as a traitor?”
They did not try to hide what they said from the ears of
Hana as she stood arranging the day’s flowers in the
veranda near by, and she knew they spoke on purpose
that she might hear. That they were right she knew too in
most of her being. But there was another part of her which
she herself could not understand. It was not sentimental
liking of the prisoner. She had come to think of him as a
prisoner. She had not liked him even yesterday when he

had said in his impulsive way, “Anyway, let me tell you
that my name is Tom.” She had only bowed her little distant
bow. She saw hurt in his eyes but she did not wish to
assuage it. Indeed, he was a great trouble in this house.
As for Sadao, every day he examined the wound
carefully. The last stitches had been pulled out this
morning, and the young man would, in a fortnight be nearly
as well as ever. Sadao went back to his office and carefully
typed a letter to the Chief of police reporting the whole
matter. “On the twenty-first day of February an escaped
prisoner was washed up on the shore in front of my house.”
So far he typed and then he opened a secret drawer of his
desk and put the unfinished report into it.
On the seventh day after that, two things happened. In
the morning the servants left together, their belongings tied in
large square cotton kerchiefs. When Hana got up in the morning
nothing was done, the house not cleaned and the food not
prepared, and she knew what it meant. She was dismayed
and even terrified, but her pride as a mistress would not allow
her to show it. Instead, she inclined her head gracefully when
they appeared before her in the kitchen, and she paid them off
and thanked them for all that they had done for her. They
were crying, but she did not cry. The cook and the gardener
had served Sadao since he was a little boy in his father’s
house, and Yumi cried because of the children. She was so
grieving that after she had gone she ran back to Hana.
“If the baby misses me too much tonight, send for me.
I am going to my own house and you know where it is.”
“Thank you,” Hana said smiling. But she told herself
she would not send for Yumi however the baby cried.
She made the breakfast and Sadao helped with the
children. Neither of them spoke of the servants beyond the
fact that they were gone. But after Hana had taken morning
food to the prisoner, she came back to Sadao.
“Why is it we cannot see clearly what we ought to do?”
she asked him. “Even the servants see more clearly than
we do. Why are we different from other Japanese?”
Sadao did not answer. But a little later he went into
the room where the prisoner was and said brusquely, “Today

you may get up on your feet. I want you to stay up only five
minutes at a time. Tomorrow you may try it twice as long.
It would be well that you get back your strength as quickly
as possible.”
He saw the flicker of terror on the young face that was
still very pale. “Okay,” the boy murmured. Evidently he
was determined to say more. “I feel I ought to thank you,
Doctor, for having saved my life.”
“Don’t thank me too early,” Sadao said coldly. He saw
the flicker of terror again in the boy’s eyes — terror as
unmistakable as an animal’s. The scars on his neck were
crimson for a moment. Those scars! What were they? Sadao
did not ask.
In the afternoon the second thing happened. Hana,
working hard on unaccustomed labour, saw a messenger
come to the door in official uniform. Her hands went weak
and she could not draw her breath. The servants must
have told already. She ran to Sadao, gasping, unable to
utter a word. But by then the messenger had simply
followed her through the garden and there he stood. She
pointed at him helplessly.
Sadao looked up from his book. He
was in his office, the other partition of
which was thrown open to the garden
for the southern sunshine.

messenger and then he rose, seeing the

enemy?
“Oh,” Hana breathed, “is that all?”
“All?” the messenger exclaimed.
“Is it not enough?”
“Indeed it is,” she replied. “I am very sorry.”
When Sadao came to say goodbye, she was in the
kitchen, but doing nothing. The children were asleep and
she sat merely resting for a moment, more exhausted from
her fright than from work.

“I thought they had come to arrest you”, she said.
He gazed down into her anxious eyes. “I must get rid of
this man for your sake,” he said in distress. “Somehow I
must get rid of him.”
(Sadao goes to see the General)
“Of course,” the General said weakly, “I understand
fully. But that is because, I once took a degree in Princeton.
So few Japanese have.”
“I care nothing for the man, Excellency,” Sadao said,
“but having operated on him with such success…”
“Yes, yes” the General said. “It only makes me feel you
more indispensable to me. Evidently you can save anyone
— you are so skilled. You say you think I can stand one
more such attack as I have had today?”
“Not more than one,” Sadao said.
“Then certainly I can allow nothing to happen to you,”
the General said with anxiety. His long pale Japanese face
became expressionless, which meant that he was in deep
thought. “You cannot be arrested,” the General said, closing
his eyes. “Suppose you were condemned to death and the
next day I had to have my operation?”
“There are other surgeons, Excellency,” Sadao suggested.
“None I trust,” the General replied. “The best ones have
been trained by Germans and would consider the operation
successful even if I died. I do not care for their point of
view.” He sighed. “It seems a pity that we cannot better
combine the German ruthlessness with the American
sentimentality. Then you could turn your prisoner over to
execution and yet I could be sure you would not murder me
while I was unconscious.” The General laughed. He had an
unusual sense of humour. “As a Japanese, could you not
combine these two foreign elements?” he asked.
Sadao smiled. “I am not quite sure,” he said, “but for
your sake I would be willing to try, Excellency.”
The General shook his head. “I had rather not be the
test case,” he said. He felt suddenly weak and overwhelmed
with the cares of his life as an official in times such as these
when repeated victory brought great responsibilities all over

the south Pacific. “It is very unfortunate that this man should
have washed up on your doorstep,” he said irritably.
“I feel it so myself,” Sadao said gently.
“It would be best if he could be quietly killed,” the
General said. “Not by you, but by someone who does not
know him. I have my own private assassins. Suppose I
send two of them to your house tonight or better, any night.
You need know nothing about it. It is now warm — what
would be more natural than that you should leave the
outer partition of the white man’s room open to the garden
while he sleeps?”
“Certainly it would be very natural,” Sadao agreed. “In
fact, it is so left open every night.”
“Good,” the General said, yawning. “They are very
capable assassins — they make no noise and they know
the trick of inward bleeding. If you like I can even have
them remove the body.”
Sadao considered. “That perhaps would be best,
Excellency,” he agreed, thinking of Hana.
He left the General’s presence then and went home,
thinking over the plan. In this way the whole thing would
be taken out of his hands. He would tell Hana nothing,
since she would be timid at the idea of assassins in the
house, and yet certainly such persons were essential in an
absolute state such as Japan was. How else could rulers
deal with those who opposed them?
He refused to allow anything but reason to be the
atmosphere of his mind as he went into the room where
the American was in bed. But as he opened the door, to his
surprise he found the young man out of bed, and preparing
to go into the garden.
“What is this!” he exclaimed. “Who gave you permission
to leave your room?”
“I’m not used to waiting for permission,” Tom said gaily.
“Gosh, I feel pretty good again! But will the muscles on
this side always feel stiff?”
“Is it so?” Sadao inquired, surprised. He forgot all else.
“Now I thought I had provided against that,” he murmured.
He lifted the edge of the man’s shirt and gazed at the healing

scar. “Massage may do it,” he said, “if exercise does not.”
“It won’t bother me much,” the young man said. His
young face was gaunt under the stubbly blond beard. “Say,
Doctor, I’ve got something I want to say to you. If I hadn’t met
a Jap like you — well, I wouldn’t be alive today. I know that.”
Sadao bowed but he could not speak.
“Sure, I know that,” Tom went on warmly. His big thin
hands gripping a chair were white at the knuckles. “I guess
if all the Japs were like you there wouldn’t have been a
war.”
“Perhaps,” Sadao said with difficulty. “And now I think
you had better go back to bed.”
He helped the boy back into bed and then bowed. “Good
night,” he said.
Sadao slept badly that night. Time and time again he
woke, thinking he heard the rustling of footsteps, the sound
of a twig broken or a stone displaced in the garden — a
noise such as men might make who carried a burden.
The next morning he made the excuse to go first into
the guest room. If the American were gone he then could
simply tell Hana that so the General had directed. But when
he opened the door he saw at once that there on the pillow
was the shaggy blond head. He could hear the peaceful
breathing of sleep and he closed the door again quietly.
“He is asleep,” he told Hana. “He is almost well to
sleep like that.”
“What shall we do with him?” Hana whispered her old
refrain.
Sadao shook his head. “I must decide in a day or two,”
he promised.
But certainly, he thought, the second night must be
the night. There rose a wind that night, and he listened to
the sounds of bending boughs and whistling partitions.
Hana woke too. “Ought we not to go and close the sick
man’s partition?” she asked.
“No,” Sadao said. “He is able now to do it for himself.”
But the next morning the American was still there.
Then the third night of course must be the night. The
wind changed to quiet rain and the garden was full of the

sound of dripping eaves and running springs. Sadao slept
a little better, but he woke at the sound of a crash and
leaped to his feet.
“What was that?” Hana cried. The baby woke at her
voice and began to wail. “I must go and see,”
But he held her and would not let her move.
“Sadao,” she cried, “what is the matter with you?”
“Don’t go,” he muttered, “don’t go!”
His terror infected her and she stood breathless,
waiting. There was only silence. Together they crept back
into the bed, the baby between them.
Yet when he opened the door of the guest room in the
morning there was the young man. He was very gay and
had already washed and was now on his feet. He had asked
for a razor yesterday and had shaved himself and today
there was a faint colour in his cheeks.
“I am well,” he said joyously.
Sadao drew his kimono round his weary body. He could
not, he decided suddenly, go through another night. It was
not that he cared for this young man’s life. No, simply it
was not worth the strain.
“You are well,” Sadao agreed. He
lowered his voice. “You are so well that I
think if I put my boat on the shore

the season of storm. You could live there
until you saw a Korean fishing boat pass
by. They pass quite near the island because the water is
many fathoms deep there.”
The young man stared at him, slowly comprehending.
“Do I have to?” he asked.
“I think so,” Sadao said gently. “You understand — it
is not hidden that you are here.”

The young man nodded in perfect comprehension.
“Okay,” he said simply.
Sadao did not see him again until evening. As soon as
it was dark he had dragged the stout boat down to the
shore and in it he put food and bottled water that he had
bought secretly during the day, as well as two quilts he
had bought at a pawnshop. The boat he tied to a post in
the water, for the tide was high. There was no moon and
he worked without a flashlight.
When he came to the house he entered as though he
were just back from his work, and so Hana knew nothing.
“Yumi was here today,” she said as she served his supper.
Though she was so modern, still she did not eat with him.
“Yumi cried over the baby,” she went on with a sigh. “She
misses him so.”
“The servants will come back as soon as the foreigner
is gone,” Sadao said.
He went into the guest room that night before he went
to bed himself and checked carefully the American’s
temperature, the state of the wound, and his heart and
pulse. The pulse was irregular but that was perhaps because
of excitement. The young man’s pale lips were pressed
together and his eyes burned. Only the scars on his neck
were red.
“I realise you are saving my life again,” he told Sadao.
“Not at all,” Sadao said. “It is only inconvenient to have
you here any longer.”
He had hesitated a good deal about giving the man a
flashlight. But he had decided to give it to him after all. It
was a small one, his own, which he used at night when he
was called.
“If your food runs out before you catch a boat,” he
said, “signal me two flashes at the same instant the sun
drops over the horizon. Do not signal in darkness, for it will
be seen. If you are all right but still there, signal me once.
You will find fresh fish easy to catch but you must eat
them raw. A fire would be seen.”
“Okay,” the young man breathed.

He was dressed now in the Japanese clothes which
Sadao had given him, and at the last moment Sadao
wrapped a black cloth about his blond head.
“Now,” Sadao said.
The young American, without a word, shook Sadao’s
hand warmly, and then walked quite well across the floor
and down the step into the darkness of the garden. Once
— twice... Sadao saw his light flash to find his way. But
that would not be suspected. He waited until from the
shore there was one more flash. Then he closed the
partition. That night he slept.
“You say the man escaped?” the General asked faintly.
He had been operated upon a week before, an emergency
operation to which Sadao had been called in the night. For
twelve hours Sadao had not been sure the General would
live. The gall bladder was much involved. Then the old
man had begun to breathe deeply again and to demand
food. Sadao had not been able to ask about the assassins.
So far as he knew they had never come. The servants had
returned and Yumi had cleaned the guest room thoroughly
and had burned sulphur in it to get the white man’s smell
out of it. Nobody said anything. Only the gardener was
cross because he had got behind with his chrysanthemums.
But after a week Sadao felt the General was well
enough to be spoken to about the prisoner.
“Yes, Excellency, he escaped,” Sadao now said. He
coughed, signifying that he had not said all he might have
said, but was unwilling to disturb the
General further. But the old man
opened his eyes suddenly.
“That prisoner,” he said with
some energy, “did I not promise
you I would kill him for you?”

“You did, Excellency,” Sadao said.
“Well, well!” the old man said in a tone of amazement,
“so I did! But you see, I was suffering a good deal. The
truth is, I thought of nothing but myself. In short, I forgot
my promise to you.”
“I wondered, Your Excellency,” Sadao murmured.
“It was certainly very careless of me,” the General said.
“But you understand it was not lack of patriotism or
dereliction of duty.” He looked anxiously at his doctor. “If
the matter should come out you would understand that,
wouldn’t you?”
“Certainly, Your Excellency,” Sadao said. He suddenly
comprehended that the General was in the palm of his
hand and that as a consequence he himself was perfectly
safe. “I can swear to your loyalty, Excellency,” he said to
the old General, “and to your zeal against the enemy.”
“You are a good man,” the General murmured and
closed his eyes.” “You will be rewarded.”
But Sadao, searching the spot of black in the twilighted
sea that night, had his reward. There was no prick of light
in the dusk. No one was on the island. His prisoner was
gone — safe, doubtless, for he had warned him to wait
only for a Korean fishing boat.
He stood for a moment on the veranda, gazing out to
the sea from whence the young man had come that other
night. And into his mind, although without reason, there
came other white faces he had known — the professor at
whose house he had met Hana, a dull man, and his wife
had been a silly talkative woman, in spite of her wish to be
kind. He remembered his old teacher of anatomy, who had
been so insistent on mercy with the knife, and then he
remembered the face of his fat and slatternly landlady. He
had had great difficulty in finding a place to live in America
because he was a Japanese. The Americans were full of
prejudice and it had been bitter to live in it, knowing himself
their superior. How he had despised the ignorant and dirty
old woman who had at last consented to house him in her
miserable home! He had once tried to be grateful to her
because she had in his last year nursed him through

influenza, but it was difficult, for she was no less repulsive
to him in her kindness. Now he remembered the youthful,
haggard face of his prisoner — white and repulsive.
“Strange,” he thought. “I wonder why I could not kill
him?”
