Before you read

Have you ever found yourself in a situation in which what happened
was the opposite of what you expected? If so, you are familiar with the
‘irony’ of the situation, which is often embarrassing. The story that you
are going to read has a number of such situations.
Soapy is a homeless, jobless man.
Winter is fast approaching and Soapy must have a place
to stay.
Soapy comes to a decision, at last.

o

SOAPY moved restlessly on his seat in Madison Square. There
are certain signs to show that winter is coming. Birds begin
to fly south. People want new warm coats. And Soapy moves
restlessly on his seat in the park. When you see these signs,
you know that winter is near.
A dead leaf fell at Soapy’s feet. That was a special sign
for him that winter was coming. It was time for all who lived
in Madison Square to prepare.
Soapy’s mind now realised that fact. The time had come.
He had to find some way to take care of himself during
the cold weather. And, therefore, he moved restlessly on
his seat.

Soapy’s hopes for the winter were not very high. He was
not thinking of sailing away on a ship. He was not thinking
of southern skies, or of the Bay of Naples. Three months in
the prison on Blackwell’s Island was what he wanted. Three
months of food every day and a bed every night, three
months safe from the cold north wind and safe from cops.
This is what Soapy wanted most in the world.
For years, Blackwell’s Island had been his winter home.
Richer New Yorkers made their plans to go to Florida or to
the shore of the Mediterranean Sea each winter. Soapy made
his small plans for going to the Island.
And now, the time had
come. Three big newspapers,
some under his coat and
some over his legs, had not
kept him warm during the
night in the park.

So
Soapy
was
thinking of the Island.
There were places in the
city where he could go
and ask for food and a
bed. These would be
given to him. He could
move from one building
to another, and he would

southern skies: warmer places Blackwell’s Island: name of a prison (If
Soapy went to prison, the government would look after his food
and stay.) cop: policeman (American English)

be taken care of through the winter. But he liked Blackwell’s
Island better.
Soapy’s spirit was proud. If he went to any of these places,
there were certain things he had to do. In one way or another,
he would have to pay for what they gave him. They would
not ask him for money. But they would make him wash his
whole body. They would make him answer questions. They
would want to know everything about his life.
No. Prison was better than that. The prison had rules
that he would have to follow. But in prison, a gentleman’s
own life was still his own life.
Soapy, having decided to go to the Island, at once began
to move towards his desire.

Soapy does his best to be on the wrong side of the law.
He tries three tricks, all in vain.
The fear that no cop will ever catch him makes him sick
at heart.

There were many easy ways of doing this. The most
pleasant way was to go and have a good dinner at some
fine restaurant. Then he would say that he had no money
to pay. And then a cop would be called. It would all be
done very quietly. The cop would arrest him. He would be
taken to a judge. The judge would do the rest.
Soapy left his seat and walked slowly out of Madison
Square to the place where the great street called Broadway
and Fifth Avenue meet. He went across this wide space
and started north on Broadway. He stopped at a large and
brightly lighted restaurant. This was where the best
food and the best people in the best clothes appeared
every evening.
Soapy believed that above his legs he looked all right.
His face was clean. His coat was good enough. If he could
get to a table, he believed that success would be his. The

d
e
h
s

part of him that would be seen above the table would look
all right. The waiter would bring him what he asked for.
He began thinking of what he would like to eat. In his
mind he could see the whole dinner. The cost would not be
too high. He did not want the restaurant people to feel any
real anger. But the dinner would leave him filled and happy
for the journey to his winter home.
But as Soapy put his foot inside the restaurant door,
the head waiter saw his broken old shoes and the torn
clothes that covered his legs. Strong and ready hands
turned Soapy around and moved him quietly and quickly
outside again.
Soapy turned off Broadway. It seemed that this most
easy way to the Island was not to be his. He must think of
some other way of getting there.
At a corner of Sixth Avenue was a shop with a wide
glass window, bright with electric lights. Soapy picked up
a big stone and threw it through the glass. People came
running around the corner. A cop was the first among them.
Soapy stood still, and he smiled when he saw the cop.

“Where’s the man that did that?” asked the cop.
“Don’t you think that I might have done it?” said Soapy.
He was friendly and happy. What he wanted was coming
towards him.
But the cop’s mind would not consider Soapy. Men who
break windows do not stop there to talk to cops. They run
away as fast as they can. The cop saw a man further along
the street, running. He ran after him. And Soapy, sick at
heart, walked slowly away. He had failed two times.
Across the street was another restaurant. It was not so
fine as the one on Broadway. The people who went there
were not so rich. Its food was not so good. Into this Soapy
took his old shoes and his torn clothes, and no one stopped
him. He sat down at a table and was soon eating a big dinner.

When he had finished, he said that he had no money.
“Get busy and call a cop,” said Soapy. “And don’t keep
a gentleman waiting.”
“No cop for you,” said the waiter. He called another waiter.
The two waiters threw Soapy upon his left ear on the
hard street outside.
He stood up slowly, one part at a time, and beat the
dust from his clothes. Prison seemed only a happy dream.
The Island seemed very far away.
A cop who was standing near laughed and walked away.
Soapy started moving again. When he stopped, he was near
several theatres. In this part of the city, streets are brighter
and hearts are more joyful than in other parts. Women and
men in rich warm coats moved happily in the winter air.
A sudden fear caught Soapy. No cop was going to
arrest him.

An Alien Hand

Soapy tries his luck twice again, but cops remain indifferent
as ever.
Soapy is suddenly reminded of his childhood home and
mother, and resolves to turn over a new leaf.
Feeling a hand on his arm, Soapy turns around to see the
broad face of a cop.

Then he came to another cop standing in front of a big
theatre. He thought of something else to try.
He began to shout as if he had too much to drink. His voice
was as loud as he could make it. He danced, he cried out.
And the cop turned his back to Soapy, and said to a
man standing near him, “It’s one of those college boys. He
won’t hurt anything. We have orders to let them shout.”
Soapy was quiet. Was no cop going to touch him? He began
to think of the Island as if it were as far away as a star. He
pulled his thin coat around him. The wind was very cold.
Then he saw a man in a shop buying a newspaper. The
man’s umbrella stood beside the door. Soapy stepped
inside the shop, took the umbrella, and walked slowly away.
The man followed
him quickly.
“My umbrella,” he
said.
“Oh, is it?” said
Soapy. “Why don’t
you call a cop? I took
it. Your umbrella!
Why don’t you call
a cop? There’s one
standing at the
corner.”
The man walked
more slowly. Soapy
did the same. But

he had a feeling that he was going to fail again. The cop
looked at the two men.
“I—” said the umbrella man “— that is — you know how
these things happen; if that’s your umbrella, I’m very sorry.
I found it this morning in a restaurant. If you say it’s yours
I hope you’ll—”
“It’s mine!” cried Soapy, with anger in his voice.
The umbrella man hurried away. The cop helped a lady
across the street. Soapy walked east. He threw the umbrella
as far as he could throw it. He talked to himself about cops
and what he thought of them. Because he wished to be
arrested, they seemed to believe he was like a king who could
do no wrong.
At last, Soapy came to one of the quiet streets on the side
of the city. He turned here and began to walk south toward
Madison Square. He was going home, although home was
only a seat in a park.
But at a very quiet corner, Soapy stopped. Here was his
old childhood home. Through one window, he could see a
soft light shining. That had been his living room, where he
had spent many happy peaceful moments. Sweet music
came to Soapy’s ears and seemed to hold him there.
The moon was above, peaceful and bright. There were
few people passing. He could hear birds high above him.
And the music that came from the room held Soapy there,
for he had known it well long ago. In those days, his life
contained such things as mothers and flowers and high
hopes and friends and clean thoughts and clean clothes.
There was a sudden and wonderful change in his soul.
He saw with sick fear how he had fallen. He saw his
worthless days, his wrong desires, his dead hopes, the lost
power of his mind.
And also, in a moment, his heart answered this change in
his soul. He would fight to change his life. He would pull himself
up, out of the mud. He would make a man of himself again.

There was time. He was young enough. He would find
his old purpose in life, and follow it. That sweet music had
changed him. Tomorrow he would find work. A man had
once offered him a job. He would find that man tomorrow.
He would be somebody in the world. He would. Soapy felt
a hand on his arm. He looked quickly around into the broad
face of a cop.
“What are you doing hanging around here?” asked the cop.
“Nothing,” said Soapy.
“You think I believe that?” said the cop.
Full of his new strength, Soapy began to argue. And it is
not wise to argue with a New York cop.
“Come along,” said the cop.
“Three months prison on Blackwell’s Island,” said the
judge to Soapy next morning.
