A Watering Rhyme
Early in the morning,
Or the evening hour,
Are the times to water
Every kind of flower.
Watering at noonday,
When the sun is high,
Doesn’t help the flowers,
Only makes them die.

Also, when you water,
Water at the roots;
Flowers keep their mouths where
We should wear our boots.
Soak the earth around them,
Then through all the heat
The flowers will have water
For their thirsty ‘feet’!

Narrator : Once there was a tree and it loved a little boy.
Every day the boy would visit the tree and enjoy its
company.
Tree : Come here, my boy. Come and
climb up my trunk and swing from my
branches.
Boy : (swinging from branches)
Ah, what fun!
Tree : Are you hungry? Eat
my apples.

Boy : (eating apples) How
delicious!

Narrator : When the boy was tired, he
slept under the tree. The tree was happy
to give its shade. But time went by.
And the boy grew older and went away.

tree was often
alone. After some
years... One day the
boy came to the tree and
the tree was very happy.

Boy : I am too big to climb and

Can you give me some money?

Tree : I’m sorry but I have no
money. I have only leaves and
apples. You can pluck my apples
and sell them in the market. Then
you will have money.

Narrator : The boy happily plucked the
apples and carried them away. The
tree was also happy. But the boy
stayed away for a long time and
the tree was sad. One day, the
boy came back and the
tree shook with joy.

The tree was very happy.

But the boy stayed away for a long time and the tree
was sad again.
And when he came back after some years, the tree
was so happy that it could hardly speak. Now, the
boy was a young man.
Tree : Come, Boy, come. What can I do for you?

Young man : I am going on a business trip. I want a
boat to take me away. Can you give me a boat?
Tree : All I have left is a trunk. Cut down my trunk
and make a boat. Then you can sail away.

Poem : A Watering Rhyme
Drama : The Giving Tree

This Unit further sensitises children to use the language that energises from their
natural surroundings.
Warm up
Divide the class into groups of four students each to read and discuss. While
groups are working encourage and help students with vocabulary or any
expressions only after you have given them a chance to make their own choices.
Reading time
Repeat the instructions as given before. Encourage children to read aloud with
voice modulation. This can now be a time of class evaluation/ assessment. Let
the class be divided into four groups and each group can be assessed for reading
by the other on scales like –
1. Excellent! 2. Good
3. Try harder
