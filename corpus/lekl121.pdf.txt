Non-fiction is virtually everything that we read as
literature but that does not come under the
categories of novel, short story, play or poem. Nonfiction, then, is writing that is factually true. It
can include articles, editorials, reports, critical
essays and interviews, humorous sketches,
biographies and autobiographies, lectures,
speeches and sermons.

This section contains six non-fiction pieces, three
by established writers of the canon: George
Ber nard Shaw, Virginia Woolf and D.H.Lawrence;
one each by Ingmar Bergman, Amartya Sen and
Isaac Asimov.
The themes are: freedom, stream of consciousness,
importance of the novel as a creative form, the
details that make film-making a creative art and
the argumentative tradition in Indian culture
based on the famous dialogue between Krishna
and Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita. Asimov’s piece
talks of the universe of science fiction, correlating
it to accounts of mythical superhuman beings in
the pre-scientific universe which served to fulfil
the same emotional needs as science fiction does.

The purpose of such writing is to explain, analyse,
define or clarify something—to provide us with
information and to show the how and why of
things.

G.B. Shaw
1856-1950

George Bernard Shaw was a dramatist and critic.
His work as a London newspaper critic of music
and drama resulted in The Quintessence of
Ibsenism. His famous plays include Arms and
the Man, Candida and Man and Superman.
His works present a fearless intellectual criticism,
sugar-coated by a pretended lightness of tone. He
rebelled against muddled thinking, and sought to
puncture hollow pretensions.

What is a perfectly free person? Evidently a person who
can do what he likes, when he likes, and where he likes,
or do nothing at all if he prefers it. Well, there is no such
person, and there never can be any such person. Whether
we like it or not, we must all sleep for one third of our
lifetime—wash and dress and undress—we must spend a
couple of hours eating and drinking—we must spend nearly
as much in getting about from place to place. For half the
day we are slaves to necessities which we cannot shirk,
whether we are monarchs with a thousand slaves or humble
labourers with no servants but their wives. And the wives
must undertake the additional heavy slavery of childbearing, if the world is still to be peopled.
These natural jobs cannot be shirked. But they involve
other jobs which can. As we must eat we must first provide
food; as we must sleep, we must have beds, and bedding
in houses with fireplaces and coals; as we must walk
through the streets, we must have clothes to cover our
nakedness. Now, food and houses and clothes can be

o
n

d
e

produced by human labour. But when they are produced
they can be stolen. If you like honey you can let the bees
produce it by their labour, and then steal it from them. If
you are too lazy to get about from place to place on your
own legs you can make a slave of a horse. And what you do
to a horse or a bee, you can also do to a man or woman or
a child, if you can get the upper hand of them by force or
fraud or trickery of any sort, or even by teaching them
that it is their religious duty to sacrifice their freedom to
yours.
So beware! If you allow any person, or class of persons,
to get the upper hand of you, he will shift all that part of
his slavery to Nature that can be shifted on to your
shoulders; and you will find yourself working from eight to
fourteen hours a day when, if you had only yourself and
your family to provide for, you could do it quite comfortably
in half the time or less. The object of all honest governments
should be to prevent your being imposed on in this way.
But the object of most actual governments, I regret to say,
is exactly the opposite. They enforce your slavery and call
it freedom. But they also regulate your slavery, keeping
the greed of your masters within certain bounds. When
chattel slavery of the negro sort costs more than wage
slavery, they abolish chattel slavery and make you free to
choose between one employment or one master and another
and this they call a glorious triumph for freedom, though
for you it is merely the key of the street. When you complain,
they promise that in future you shall govern the country
for yourself. They redeem this promise by giving you a vote,
and having a general election every five years or so.
At the election two of their rich friends ask for your
vote and you are free to choose which of them you will vote for
to spite the other—a choice which leaves you no freer than
you were before, as it does not reduce your hours of labour by
a single minute. But the newspapers assure you that your
vote has decided the election, and that this constitutes you a
free citizen in a democratic country. The amazing thing about
it is that you are fool enough to believe them.
Now mark another big difference between the natural
slavery of man to Nature and the unnatural slavery of

man to man. Nature is kind to her slaves. If she forces you
to eat and drink, she makes eating and drinking so pleasant
that when we can afford it we eat and drink too much. We
must sleep or go mad: but then sleep is so pleasant that
we have great difficulty in getting up in the morning. And
firesides and families seem so pleasant to the young that
they get married and join building societies to realise their
dreams. Thus, instead of resenting our natural wants as
slavery, we take the greatest pleasure in their satisfaction.
We write sentimental songs in praise of them. A tramp can
earn his supper by singing Home, Sweet Home.
The slavery of man to man is the very opposite of this.
It is hateful to the body and to the spirit. Our poets do not
praise it: they proclaim that no man is good enough to be
another man’s master. The latest of the great Jewish
prophets, a gentleman named Marx, spent his life in
proving that there is no extremity of selfish cruelty at which
the slavery of man to man will stop if it be not stopped by
law. You can see for yourself that it produces a state of
continual civil war—called the class war—between the
slaves and their masters, organised as Trade Unions on
one side and Employers’ Federations on the other. Saint
Thomas More, who has just been canonized, held that we
shall never have a peaceful and stable society until this
struggle is ended by the abolition of slavery altogether,
and the compulsion of everyone to do his share of the
world’s work with his own hands and brains, and not to
attempt to put it on anyone else.
Naturally the master class, through its parliaments
and schools and newspapers, makes the most desperate
efforts to prevent us from realising our slavery. From our
earliest years we are taught that our country is the land of
the free, and that our freedom was won for us by our
forefathers when they made King John sign Magna Charta
(also spelt Carta)—when they defeated the Spanish
Armada—when they cut off King Charles’s head—when they
made King William accept the Bill of Rights—when they
issued and made good the American Declaration of
Independence—when they won the battles of Waterloo and

Trafalgar on the playing-fields of Eton—and when, only
the other day, they quite unintentionally changed the
German, Austrian, Russian, and Ottoman empires into
republics.
When we grumble, we are told that all our miseries
are our own doing because we have the vote. When we say
‘What good is the vote?’ we are told that we have the Factory
Acts, and the Wages Boards, and free education, and the
New Deal, and the dole; and what more could any
reasonable man ask for? We are reminded that the rich
are taxed a quarter—a third—or even a half and more of
their incomes; but the poor are never reminded that they
have to pay that much of their wages as rent in addition to
having to work twice as long every day as they would need
if they were free.
Whenever famous writers protest against this
imposture—say Voltaire and Rousseau and Tom Paine
in the eighteenth century, or Cobbett and Shelley, Karl
Marx and Lassalle in the nineteenth, or Lenin and
T rotsky in the twentieth—you are taught that they are
atheists and libertines, murderers and scoundrels, and
often it is made a criminal offence to buy or sell their
books. If their disciples make a revolution, England
immediately makes war on them and lends money to the
other Powers to join her in forcing the revolutionists
r estore the slave order. When this combination was
successful at Waterloo, the victory was advertised as
another triumph for British freedom; and the British
wage-slaves, instead of going into mourning like Lord
Byron, believed it all and cheered enthusiastically. When
the revolution wins, as it did in Russia in 1922, the
fighting stops; but the abuse, the calumnies, the lies
continue until the revolutionised State grows into a firstrate military power. Then our diplomatists, after having
for years denounced the revolutionary leaders as the
most abominable villains and tyrants, have to do a right
turn and invite them to dinner.

Now, though this prodigious mass of humbug is meant
to delude the enslaved masses only, it ends in deluding
the master class much more completely. A gentleman whose
mind has been formed at a preparatory school for the sons
of gentlemen, followed by a public school and university
course, is much more thoroughly taken in by the falsified
history and dishonest political economy and the snobbery
taught in these places than any worker can possibly be,
because the gentleman’s education teaches him that he is
a very fine fellow, superior to the common run of men
whose duty it is to brush his clothes, carry his parcels,
and earn his income for him, and as he thoroughly agrees
with this view of himself, he honestly believes that the
system which has placed him in such an agreeable situation
and done such justice to his merits is the best of all possible
systems, and that he should shed his blood, and yours, to
the last drop in its defence. But the great mass of our
rack-rented, underpaid, treated-as-inferiors cast-off-onthe-dole workers cannot feel so sure about it as the
gentleman. The facts are too harshly against it. In hard
times, such as we are now passing through, their disgust
and despair sometimes lead them to kick over the traces,
upset everything, and they have to be rescued from mere
gangsterism by some Napoleonic genius who has a fancy
for being an emperor, and who has the courage and brains
and energy to jump at the chance. But the slaves who give
three cheers for the emperor might just as well have made
a cross on a British or American ballot paper as far as
their freedom is concerned.
So far I have mentioned nothing but plain natural
and historical facts. I draw no conclusions, for that would
lead me into controversy, and controversy would not be
fair when you cannot answer me back. I am never

controversial over the wireless. I do not even ask you to
draw your own conclusions, for you might draw some very
dangerous ones, unless you have the right sort of head for
it. Always remember that though nobody likes to be called a
slave, it does not follow that slavery is a bad thing. Great
men, like Aristotle, have held that the law and order and
government would be impossible unless the persons the
people have to obey are beautifully dressed and decorated,
robed and uniformed, speaking with a special accent,
travelling in first-class carriages or the most expensive cars,
or on the best-groomed and best-bred horses, and never
cleaning their own boots, not doing anything for themselves
that can possibly be done by ringing a bell and ordering
some common person to do it. And this means, of course,
that they must be made very rich without any obligation
other than to produce an impression of almost godlike
superiority on the minds of common people. In short, it is
contended, you must make men ignorant idolaters before
they will become obedient workers and law-abiding citizens.
To prove this, we are reminded that, although nine
out of ten voters are common workers, it is with the greatest
difficulty that a few of them can be persuaded to vote for
the members of their own class. When women were
enfranchised and given the right to sit in Parliament, the
first use they made of their votes was to defeat all the
women candidates who stood for the freedom of the workers
and had given them years of devoted and distinguished
service. They elected only one woman—a titled lady of great
wealth and exceptionally fascinating personality.
Now this, it is said, is human nature, and you cannot
change human nature. On the other hand, it is maintained
that human nature is the easiest thing in the world to
change if you catch it young enough, and that the idolatry
of the slave class and the arrogance of the master class
are themselves entirely artificial products of education and
of a propaganda that plays upon our infants long before
they have left their cradles. An opposite mentality could,
it is argued, be produced by a contrary education and
propaganda. You can turn the point over in your mind for
yourself; do not let me prejudice you one way or the other.

The practical question at the bottom of it all is how
the income of the whole country can best be distributed
from day to day. If the earth is cultivated agriculturally in
vast farms with motor ploughs and chemical fertilisers,
and industrially in huge electrified factories full of
machinery that a girl can handle, the product may be so
great that an equal distribution of it would provide enough
to give the unskilled labourers as much as the managers
and the men of the scientific staff. But do not forget, when
you hear tales of modern machinery enabling one girl to
produce as much as a thousand men could produce in the
reign of good Queen Anne, that this marvelous increase
includes things like needles and steel pins and matches,
which we can neither eat nor drink nor wear. Very young
children will eat needles and matches eagerly—but the
diet is not a nourishing one. And though we can now
cultivate the sky as well as the earth, by drawing nitrogen
from it to increase and improve the quality of our grass
and, consequently, of our cattle and milk and butter and
eggs, Nature may have tricks up her sleeve to check us if
the chemists exploit her too greedily.
And now to sum up. Wipe out from your dreams of
freedom the hope of being able to do as you please all the
time. For at least twelve hours of your day Nature orders
you to do certain things, and will kill you if you don’t do
them. This leaves twelve hours for working; and here again
Nature will kill you unless you either earn your living or
get somebody else to earn it for you. If you live in a civilised
country your freedom is restricted by the laws of the land
enforced by the police, who oblige you to do this, and not
to do that, and to pay rates and taxes. If you do not obey
these laws the courts will imprison you, and, if you go too
far, kill you. If the laws are reasonable and are impartially
administered you have no reason to complain, because
they increase your freedom by protecting you against
assault, highway robbery, and disorder generally.
But as society is constituted at present, there is
another far more intimate compulsion on you: that of your
landlord and that of your employer. Your landlord may
refuse to let you live on his estate if you go to chapel instead

of to church, or if you vote for anyone but his nominee, or
if you practise osteopathy, or if you open a shop. Your
employer may dictate the cut, colour, and condition of your
clothes, as well as your hours of work. He can turn you
into the street at any moment to join the melancholy band
of lost spirits called the Unemployed. In short, his power
over you is far greater than that of any political dictator
could possibly be. Your only remedy at present is the Trade
Union weapon of the strike, which is only the old Oriental
device of starving on your enemy’s doorstep until he does
you justice. Now, as the police in this country will not
allow you to starve in your employer’s doorstep, you must
starve on your own—if you have one. The extreme form of
the strike—the general strike of all workers at the same
moment—is also the extreme form of human folly, as, if
completely carried out, it would extinguish the human race
in a week. And the workers would be the first to perish.
The general strike is Trade Unionism gone mad. Sane Trade
Unionism would never sanction more than one big strike
at a time, with all the other trades working overtime to
support it.
Now let us put the case in figures. If you have to work
for twelve hours a day you have four hours a day to do
what you like with, subject to the laws of the land, and
your possession of money enough to buy an interesting
book or pay for a seat at the pictures, or, on a half-holiday,
at a football match, or whatever your fancy may be. But
even here Nature will interfere a good deal, for, if your
eight hours’ work has been of a hard physical kind, and
when you get home you want to spend your four hours in
reading my books to improve your mind, you will find
yourself fast asleep in half a minute, and your mind will
remain in its present benighted condition.
I take it, then, that nine out of ten of us desire more
freedom, and that this is why we listen to wireless talks
about it. As long as we go on as we are—content with a
vote and a dole—the only advice we can give one another
is that of Shakespeare’s Iago: ‘Put money in thy purse.’
But as we get very little money into our purses on pay-day,
and all the rest of the week other people are taking money

out of it, Iago’s advice is not very practical. We must change
our politics before we can get what we want; and meanwhile
we must stop gassing about freedom, because the people
of England in the lump don’t know what freedom is, never
having had any. Always call freedom by its old English
name of leisure, and keep clamouring for more leisure and
more money to enjoy it in return for an honest share of
work. And let us stop singing Rule, Britannia! until we
make it true. Until we do, let us never vote for a
parliamentary candidate who talks about our freedom and
our love of liberty, for, whatever political name he may
give himself, he is sure to be at bottom an Anarchist who
wants to live on our labour without being taken up by the
police for it as he deserves.
And now suppose we at last win a lot more leisure and
a lot more money than we are accustomed to. What are we
going to do with them? I was taught in my childhood that
Satan will find mischief still for idle hands to do. I have
seen men come into a fortune and lose their happiness,
their health, and finally their lives by it as certainly as if
they had taken daily doses of rat poison instead of
champagne and cigars. It is not at all easy to know what
to do with leisure unless we have been brought up to it.
I will, therefore, leave you with a conundrum to think
over. If you had your choice, would you work for eight hours
a day and retire with a full pension at forty-five, or would
you rather work four hours a day and keep on working
until you are seventy? Now don’t send the answer to me,
please talk it over with your wife.

Understanding Freedom and Discipline
Jiddu Krishnamurti was a world renowned writer
and speaker on fundamental philosophical and
spiritual subjects such as the purpose of meditation,
human relationships, and how to bring about
positive change in global society. His supporters,
working through several non-profit foundations,
oversee a number of independent schools centred
on his views on education, in India, England and
the United States. His talks, group and individual
discussions, and other writings are published in
a variety of formats including print, audio-video
as well as online, in many languages.

J. Krishnamurti
1895-1986

The problem of discipline is really quite complex,
because most of us think that through some form of
discipline we shall eventually have freedom. Discipline is
the cultivation of resistance, is it not? By resisting, by
building a barrier within ourselves against something
which we consider wrong, we think we shall be more
capable of understanding and of being free to live fully;
but that is not a fact, is it? Surely, it is only when there is
freedom, real freedom to think, to discover—that you can
find out anything.
But freedom obviously cannot exist in a frame. And
most of us live in a frame, in a world enclosed by ideas, do
we not? For instance, you are told by your parents and
your teachers what is right and what is wrong. You know
what people say, what the priest says, what tradition says,
and what you have learned in school. All this forms a kind
of enclosure within which you live; and, living in that
enclosure, you say you are free. Are you? Can a man ever
be free as long as he lives in a prison?
So, one has to break down the prison walls of tradition.
One has to experiment and discover on one’s own, and not
merely follow somebody, however good, however noble and
exciting that person may be, and however happy one may
feel in his presence. What has significance is to be able to

o
n

d
e

129/FREEDOM

examine and not just accept all the values created by
tradition, all the things that people have said are good,
beneficial, worthwhile. The moment you accept, you begin
to conform, to imitate; and conforming, imitating, following,
can never make one free and happy.
Our elders say that you must be disciplined. Discipline
is imposed upon you by yourself, and by others from outside.
But what is important is to be free to think, to inquire, so
that you begin to find out for yourself. To think deeply, to
go into things and discover for oneself what is true, is very
difficult; it requires alert perception, constant inquiry, and
most people have neither the inclination nor the energy
for that. They say, ‘You know better than I do; you are my
guru, my teacher, and I shall follow you.’
So, it is very important that from the tenderest age
you are free to find out, and are not enclosed by a wall of
do’s and don’ts; for if you are constantly told what to do
and what not to do, what will happen to your intelligence?
You will be a thoughtless entity who just walks into some
career, who is told by his parents whom to marry or not to
marry; and that is obviously not the action of intelligence.
You may pass your examinations and be very well off, you
may have good clothes and plenty of jewels, you may have
friends and prestige; but as long as you are bound by
tradition, there can be no intelligence.
Surely, intelligence comes into being only when you
are free to question, free to think out and discover, so that
your mind becomes very active, very alert and clear. Then
you are a fully integrated individual—not a frightened entity
who, not knowing what to do, inwardly feels one thing and
outwardly conforms to something different.
Intelligence demands that you break away from
tradition and live on your own; but you are enclosed by
your parents’ ideas and by the traditions of society. So
there is a conflict going on inwardly, is there not? You are
all young, but I don’t think you are too young to be aware
of this. So there is an inward struggle going on; and as
long as you do not resolve that struggle you are going to be
caught in conflict, in pain, in sorrow, everlastingly wanting
to do something and being prevented from doing it.

If you go into it very carefully you will see that discipline
and freedom are contradictory, and that in seeking real freedom
there is set going quite a different process which brings its
own clarification so that you just do not do certain things.
While you are young it is very important that
you be free to find out, and be helped to find out,
what you really want to do in life. If you don’t find out while
you are young, you will never find out, you
will never be free and happy individuals. The seed
must be sown now, so that you begin now to take the initiative.
On the road you have often passed villagers carrying
heavy loads, have you not? Those poor women with torn
and dirty clothes, with insufficient food, working day after
day for a pittance—do you have any feeling for them? Or
are you so frightened, so concerned about yourself, about
your examinations, about your looks, about your saris, that
you never pay any attention to them? Do you feel you are
much better than they, that you belong to a higher class
and therefore need have no regard for them? Don’t you
want to help them? No? That indicates how you are
thinking. Are you so dulled by centuries of tradition, by
what your fathers and mothers say, so conscious of
belonging to a certain class, that you do not even look at
the villagers? Are you actually so blinded that you do not
know what is happening around you?
It is fear—fear of what your parents will say, of what
the teachers will say, fear of tradition, fear of life—that
gradually destroys sensitivity, is it not? To be sensitive is
to feel, to receive impressions, to have sympathy for those
who are suffering, to have affection, to be aware of the
things that are happening around you. When the temple
bell is ringing, are you aware of it? Do you listen to the
sound? Do you ever see the sunlight on the water? Are you
aware of the poor people, the villagers who have been
controlled, trodden down for centuries by exploiters? When
you see a servant carrying a heavy carpet, do you give him
a helping hand?
All this implies sensitivity. But, you see, sensitivity is
destroyed when one is disciplined, when one is fearful or
concerned with oneself. To be concerned about one’s looks,

about one’s saris, to think about oneself all the time—
which most of us do in some form or other—is to be
insensitive, for then the mind and heart are enclosed and
one loses all appreciation of beauty.
To be really free implies great sensitivity. There is no
freedom if you are enclosed by self-interest or by various
walls of discipline. As long as your life is a process of
imitation there can be no sensitivity, no freedom. It is very
important, while you are here, to sow the seed of freedom,
which is to awaken intelligence; for with that intelligence
you can tackle all the problems of life.

Grammar

Sentence Types

The smallest meaningful unit in language is the word. Words
combine to form phrases, clauses and sentences.
• a sentence consists of one or more clauses
• a clause consists of one or more phrases
• a phrase consists of one or more words.
Look at these examples

(i) Nature is kind to her slaves.

(ii) As we must eat we must first provide food.

(iii) You are all young, but I don’t think you are too young to be
aware of this.

Notice the use of personal pronouns in the two texts. Did this
make you identify yourself more with the topic than if it had
been written in an impersonal style? As you read the texts,
were you able to relate the writer’s thoughts with the way you
lead your own life?

In example (i) you find only one verb, is. There is only one idea
expressed. It is a single clause sentence known as a simple
sentence.

In example (ii) you find two sets of verbs, must eat and must
provide. It is a two clause sentence.
(a) As we must eat
(b) We must first provide food.
You can see that (b) is complete in its sense. This is the main
clause. The meaning of clause (a) depends on (b). This is the

133/FREEDOM

subordinate clause. Sentences with a main clause and one or
more subordinate clauses are complex sentences.
In example (iii) you again find two verbs: are and are
(a) You are all young.
(b) But I don’t think you are too young to be aware of this.
In this case (a) and (b) both make sense independent of each
other though there is a link. There are two main clauses joined
by the conjunction but. Sentences with more than one main
clause are called compound sentences.

TASK

Split the following sentences into their constituent clauses
•

There is no freedom if you are enclosed by self interest or by
various walls of discipline.

•

When you see a servant carrying a heavy carpet, do you give
him a helping hand?

•

Very young childr en will eat needles and matches eagerly—but
the diet is not a nourishing one.

•

We must sleep or go mad: but then sleep is so pleasant that we
have great difficulty in getting up in the morning.

•

Always call freedom by its old English name of leisure, and keep
clamouring for more leisure and more money to enjoy it in return
for an honest share of work.

When sentences are too long and complicated, it is useful to
look for the main clause which carries the main idea and the
subordinate clauses which carry ideas that depend on the idea
expressed in the main clause.

Sometimes we have long sentences which have one main
clause and several subordinate clauses of the same kind
depending upon the main clause or another subordinate clause
for meaning.

Notice this long sentence from the first section

From our earliest years we are taught that our country
is the land of the free, and that our freedom was won
for us by our forefathers—when they made King John
sign Magna Charta—when they defeated the Spanish
Armada—when they cut off King Charles’s head—
when they made King William accept the Bill of
Rights—when they issued and made good the
American Declaration of Independence—when they

134/K ALEIDOSCOPE

won the battles of Waterloo and T rafalgar on the
playing-fields of Eton—and when, only the other day,
they quite unintentionally changed the German,
Austrian, Russian, and Ottoman empires into
republics.

d
e

From our earliest years we are taught is the main clause; taught what?
(i) that our country is the land of the free
(ii) that our freedom was won for us by our forefathers

h
s

The succeeding five ‘when’ clauses depend upon clause ii for
their meaning. Try to understand long sentences by splitting
them into constituent clauses. Such sentences are usually
used by authors to add force to their writing by combining ideas
that are connected to one another.

Rhetorical Questions

A sentence which has the form of a question need not
necessarily ask a question. Its communicative intention may
actually be a statement.
Look at this example from the second section by J.Krishnamurti

o
n

On the road you have often passed villagers carrying
heavy loads, have you not? What is your feeling about
them? Those poor women with torn and dirty clothes,
with insufficient food, working day after day for a
pittance—do you have any feeling for them? Or are
you so frightened, so concerned about yourself, about
your examinations, about your looks, about your
saris, that you never pay any attention to them? Do
you feel you are much better than they, that you
belong to a higher class and therefore need have no
regard for them? When you see them go by, what do
you feel? Don’t you want to help them? No? That
indicates how you are thinking. Are you so dulled by
centuries of tradition, by what your fathers and
mothers say, so conscious of belonging to a certain
class, that you do not even look at the villagers? Are
you actually so blinded that you do not know what is
happening around you?

Such questions are called rhetorical questions which are used
as persuasive devices by public speakers. If the rhetorical
question is positive the implied statement is negative and vice
versa. The implied statement is the mental answer that the
speaker intends the hearer to infer from the rhetorical question.

135/FREEDOM

TASK
Pick out examples of such rhetorical questions from the text and
understand what the writer/speaker wishes to communicate through
them.

Pronunciation
The way that sounds combine to produce syllables, words and
sentences is interesting. Two classes of sound are established

(i) Vowels, or sounds that can occur on their own or are at
the centre of a sequence of sounds (indicated as V)

Notice that the two letters ee correspond to a single vowel sound.
Similarly, the two letters ai in train correspond to a single vowel
sound, as do the two letters oa in boat.

Do not confuse the vowel sounds with the names of letters of
the alphabet that are sometimes called ‘vowels’.
