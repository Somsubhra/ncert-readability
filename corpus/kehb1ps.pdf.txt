Foreword

tt

THE National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that
children's life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning
which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between
the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks
developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this
basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the
maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas.
We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the
direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the
National Policy of Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school
principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on
their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions.
We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children
generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on
to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis
of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and
sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is
possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning,
not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and
mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary
as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required
number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The
methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how
effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a
happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom.
Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular
burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different
stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time
available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this
endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for
contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and
activities requiring hands-on experience.

About the Book

no

tt

THIS textbook for Class XI is based on the English syllabus on the
lines suggested by the National Curriculum Framework, 2005.
It aims to help learners develop proficiency in English by
using language as an instrument for abstract thought and
knowledge acquisition.
In the Reading Skills section, the texts have been chosen to
mirror the kind of serious reading in real life that a school-leaver
should be capable of. The prose pieces are drawn from biographies,
travelogues, science fiction, art and contemporary expository prose
by writers from different parts of the world. Samples from journalistic
writing have also been included. The play, placed centrally in the
textbook, is on a theme that learners will particularly identify with
and is in a lighter vein. The poems relate to universal sentiments
and appeal to contemporary sensibilities.
Learners at this stage bring along with them a rich resource of
world-view, knowledge and cognitive strategies. Teachers should
encourage them to make educated guesses at what they read and
help them initially to make sense of the language of the text and
subsequently become autonomous readers. The Notes after every
Unit help the teacher and learners with strategies for dealing with
the particular piece.
The activities suggested draw upon the learners’ multilingual
experiences and capacities. Comprehension is addressed at two
levels: one of the text itself and the other of how the text relates to
the learners’ experience. The vocabulary exercises will sensitise
learners to make informed choices of words, while the points of
grammar highlighted will help them notice the use of forms. The
‘Things to Do’ section at the end of every unit invites learners to
look for other sources of information that will help them deal with
learning tasks across the curriculum.
The section on Writing Skills prepares them for the kind of
independent writing that a school-leaver will need to engage in for
academic as well as real-life purposes. Help has been provided in a
step-by-step manner to lead the learners on to make notes,
summarise, draft letters and write short essays, paying attention to
the form, content and the process of writing.
