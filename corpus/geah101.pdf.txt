Though so very small, the ant is unbelievably intelligent
and hard-working.
Among the various kinds, the commonest ant is black
or red.
Ants live in comfortable homes called ‘anthills’.
NAME the smallest insect you have seen, and the wisest. Is
it the fly? No, it isn’t. Is it the mosquito? No, not the
mosquito. Then it must be the worm. No, none of these. It
is the ant —the commonest, the smallest but the wisest
insect. The story of an ant’s life sounds almost untrue. But
people have kept ants as pets, and have watched their daily
behaviour closely. So we know a number of facts about
this tiny, hard-working and intelligent creature.
An ant uses its feelers or antennae to ‘talk’ to other
ants by passing messages through them. Watch a row of
ants moving up or down the wall. Each ant greets all the
others coming from the opposite direction by touching
their feelers.

There are many kinds of ants. The commonest among
them are the black or red ones. We have seen them since
we were children, but haven’t paid enough attention to
them. Where do they live? In their
comfortable homes called ‘nests’ or
‘anthills’. Each has hundreds of little
rooms and passages. In some of these
rooms the queen ant lays eggs. Others
are nurseries for the young ones
(called ‘grubs’). Workers have their

reserved quarters. They spend most of their time searching
for food. Some rooms serve as storehouses for this food.
Soldiers have separate barracks. No worker has ever tried
to live in a soldier’s house; no soldier has ever gone out
searching for food. No worker or soldier or cleaner has ever
harmed a grub. So you see, an ant’s life is very peaceful.
Each does its share of work intelligently and bravely, and
never fights with other members of the group.

1. The story of an ant’s life sounds almost untrue.
The italicised phrase means
(i) highly exaggerated.
(ii) too remarkable to be true.
(iii) not based on facts.

3. In what ways is an ant’s life peaceful?

The queen ant has a pair of wings, which she casts off
before she begins to lay eggs.
Eggs hatch and become grubs, grubs change into cocoons,
and cocoons break to bring forth complete ants.
The life of an ordinary ant in the anthill is a book which
many of us seldom open.

The queen is the mother of the entire population of the
colony. It lives for about fifteen years. It has a pair of wings,

but bites them off after its ‘wedding’ flight. This flight takes
place on a hot summer day. The queen leaves the nest and
goes out to meet a male ant, or drone, high up in the air.
On its return to earth, it gets rid of its wings and then does
nothing but lay eggs.
Eggs hatch and grubs come out. Soldiers guard them.
Workers feed and clean them, and also carry them about
daily for airing, exercise and sunshine. Two or three weeks

later, grubs become cocoons and lie without food or activity
for three weeks more. Then the cocoons break and perfect
ants appear. Now it’s time for teaching and training. New
ants learn their duties from old ants as workers, soldiers,
builders, cleaners, etc. After a few weeks’ training, the small
ants are ready to go out into the
big world of work.
An anthill is a home not only
for ants but also for some other
creatures —beetles, lesser breeds
of ants and the greenfly. Why do
ants want these alien creatures
to live in their nests? For several
reasons: some give off smell
pleasant to the ants’ senses;

others give sweet juices; and some are just pets or
playthings like cats and dogs to human beings. The greenfly
is the ants’ cow. The ants train it to give honeydew (like
milk) with a touch of their antennae. They milk it just as
we milk the cow.
Have humans learned as much as ants have? Perhaps
they have, but they haven’t put their learning to good use.
They may still learn a few things from this tiny teacher—
hard work, sense of duty and discipline, cleanliness, care
for the young ones, and, above all, a firm loyalty to the land
where they live.

How long does it take for a grub to become a complete ant?
Why do the worker ants carry the grubs about?
What jobs are new ants trained for?
Name some other creatures that live in anthills.
Mention three things we can learn from the ‘tiny teacher’. Give
reasons for choosing these items.

Discuss the following topics in groups.

1. (i) What problems are you likely to face if you keep ants as pets?

(ii) When a group of bees finds nectar, it informs other bees of
its location, quantity, etc. through dancing. Can you guess
what ants communicate to their fellow ants by touching
one another’s feelers?

A Matter of Tongue

In humans the tongue is the organ of taste. It also
helps in chewing, swallowing and speaking.
Some animals like the frog and the chameleon use
the tongue to catch prey. The chameleon’s tongue
is so long that it keeps it folded in the mouth— but it
can flick it in and out at lightning speed.
The snake uses its tongue to smell. The reptile flickers
its tongue in and out, each time carrying molecules
from its surroundings to an organ (called ‘Jacobsen’s
organ’) in the roof of its mouth.
The blue whale has the largest tongue which can
weigh as much as an elephant.
