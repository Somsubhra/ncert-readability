I'm not big enough yet,
They say.

So I patiently wait

Till I’m all grown-up;

And I’ll show Them all,
One day.

I could show Them now

If they gave me the chance,
There are things I could do
If I tried.

But nobody knows,

No nobody knows, that I’m

Really a giant,

Once upon a time there was a
small hill. A path went up the hill.
It went through thick and lovely
woods of pine and fir trees. People
often walked on it to a holy place.
One day when the sun shone
high in the sky, many people were
seen climbing up the hill. They
were climbing slowly and
carefully.
A girl also climbed the hill
with them. Her name was Meena.
Meena was twelve years old. She carried a small boy on her back.
He was four years old. His
hair was curly. His eyes were
black and his face was as
fresh as the morning dew.
As the sunshine danced
through the trees, Meena
climbed the hill slowly and
steadily. Meena was happy.
The boy was also happy.
A man in the group
looked at Meena. He felt
sorry for her. He asked her,
“My child, why are you
carrying a boy on your back?
Don't you feel his load?”
Meena looked at him in wonder. She could not understand
him. (Her brother was unable to walk). Meena asked, “Load? Of
course not! He is my brother!”

Children who cannot hear may use sign language for
communication. Sign language uses the hands to send
information and the eyes to receive them. It is a visual manual
language system with its own sentence structure and word order.
Sign language is a part of total communication method used with
people who are hard of hearing. In addition to sign language the
Total Communication method involves other modes of
communication like lipreading, voice amplification, writing,
gesture and visual imagery (pictures). Although using sign
language is important for communication, it can also be an
adventure for everyone.
Here are some words that you can learn in sign language.

THEMES

SUGGESTIONS FOR CLASSROOM TEACHING

the theme of the poem. Let
the children talk individually about something they want to do very much but
which their adults won't let them do. You can then ask them to think about
why adults seem to be behaving unreasonably and if there might be some
reason behind it e.g. if a child wants to drive a vehicle, why can’t he or she do
so?

Read the pre-reading questions aloud to introduce

ed

l
Growing up, expressing emotions and feelings.

Explain
l

to the class through examples how friends, brothers, sisters and
family are very important in the life of a person.

This Unit is a good opportunity to talk about special children, their needs and
l
problems. It is important to tell the class that special children need our
understanding and acceptance.

Encourage
l

children to guess the meanings of difficult words, before you

explain.

Discuss
l

and help them with the activities. You may explain short forms of the
words and their significance in our conversation e.g. Are – ’re, Will – ’ll. Listing
of the contractions may be done on the blackboard.

After
l

this unit is completed children can tell the class about their ambitions
i.e. what they want to be when they grow up.

For teaching sign language

start with signing a few words. Repeat in different
situations so that meaning is attached to your hand movements.
Talk when you sign. Keep your language simple. Use appropriate
facial expression with signs and speech.
