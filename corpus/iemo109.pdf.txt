They say that the world today is a small place
because travel has become easy, but not everybody
finds it easy to travel. Here, the author reflects
humorously his experiences as a traveller.

OF all the things I am not very good at, living in the real world is
perhaps the most outstanding. I am constantly filled with wonder
at the number of things that other people do without any evident
difficulty that are pretty much beyond me. I cannot tell you the
number of times that I have gone looking for the lavatory in a
cinema, for instance, and ended up standing in an alley on the
wrong side of a selflocking door. My particular specialty now is
returning to hotel desks two or three times a day and asking
what my room number is. I am, in short, easily confused.
I was thinking about this the last time we went en famille on a
big trip. It was at Easter, and we were flying to England for a
week. When we arrived at Logan Airport in Boston and were
checking in, I suddenly remembered that I had recently joined
British Airways’ frequent flyer programme. I also remembered
that I had put the card in the carry-on bag that was hanging
around my neck. And here’s where the trouble started.
The zip on the bag was jammed. So I pulled on it and yanked
at it, with grunts and frowns and increasing consternation. I
kept this up for some minutes but it wouldn’t budge, so I pulled
harder and harder, with more grunts. Well, you can guess what
happened. Abruptly the zip gave way. The side of the bag flew
open and everything within — newspaper cuttings and other
loose papers, a 14- ounce tin of pipe tobacco, magazines,
passport, English money, film — was extravagantly ejected over

o
n

an area about the size of a
tennis court.
I watched dumbstruck as
a hundred carefully sorted
documents came raining
down in a fluttery cascade,
coins bounced to a variety
of noisy oblivions and the
now-lidless tin of tobacco
rolled crazily acr oss the
concourse disgorging its
contents as it went.
“My tobacco!” I cried in
horror, thinking what I would
have to pay for that much
tobacco in England now that
another Budget had come and
gone, and then changed the
cry to “My finger! My finger!”
as I discovered that I had
gashed my finger on the zip
and was shedding blood in a
lavish manner. (I am not very
good around flowing blood generally, but when it’s my own —
well, I think hysterics are fully justified.) Confused and unable
to help, my hair went into panic mode.
It was at this point that my wife looked at me with an expression
of wonder — not anger or exasperation, but just simple wonder —
and said, “I can’t believe you do this for a living.”
But I’m afraid it’s so. I always have catastrophes when I travel.
Once on an aeroplane, I leaned over to tie a shoelace just at the
moment someone in the seat ahead of me threw his seat back
into full recline, and found myself pinned helplessly in the crash
position. It was only by clawing the leg of the man sitting next to
me that I managed to get myself freed.

On another occasion, I knocked a soft drink onto the lap of a
sweet little lady sitting beside me. The flight attendant came and
cleaned her up, and brought me a replacement drink, and instantly
I knocked it onto the woman again. To this day, I don’t know how
I did it. I just remember reaching out for the new drink and
watching helplessly as my arm, like some cheap prop in one of
those 1950s horror movies with a name like The Undead Limb,
violently swept the drink from its perch and onto her lap.
The lady looked at me with the stupefied expression you would
expect to receive from someone whom you have repeatedly
drenched, and uttered an oath that started with “Oh”, finished
with “sake” and in between had some words that I have never
heard uttered in public before, certainly not by a nun.
This, however, was not my worst experience on a plane flight.
My worst experience was when I was writing important thoughts
in a notebook (‘buy socks’, ‘clutch drinks carefully’, etc.), sucking
thoughtfully on the end of my pen as you do, and fell into

conversation with an attractive young lady in the next seat. I
amused her for perhaps 20 minutes with a scattering of urbane
bons mots, then retired to the lavatory where I discovered that
the pen had leaked and that my mouth, chin, tongue, teeth and
gums were now a striking, scrub-resistant navy blue, and would
remain so for several days.
So you will understand, I trust, when I tell you how much I
ache to be suave. I would love, just once in my life, to rise from a
dinner table without looking as if I have just experienced an
extremely localised seismic event, get in a car and close the door
without leaving 14 inches of coat outside, wear light-coloured
trousers without discovering at the end of the day that I have at
various times sat on chewing gum, ice cream, cough syrup and
motor oil. But it is not to be.
Now on planes when the food is delivered, my wife says: “Take
the lids off the food for Daddy” or “Put your hoods up, children.
Daddy's about to cut his meat”. Of course, this is only when I am
flying with my family. When I am on my own, I don’t eat, drink or
lean over to tie my shoelaces, and never put a pen anywhere near
my mouth. I just sit very, very quietly, sometimes on my hands to
keep them from flying out unexpectedly and causing liquid
mischief. It’s not much fun, but it does at least cut down on
the laundry bills.
I never did get my frequent flyer miles, by the way. I never do.
I couldn't find the card in time. This has become a real frustration
for me. Everyone I know — everyone — is forever flying off to Bali
first class with their air miles. I never get to collect anything. I
must fly 100,000 miles a year, yet I have accumulated only about
212 air miles divided between twenty-three airlines.
This is because either I forget to ask for the air miles when I
check in, or I remember to ask for them but the airline then
manages not to record them, or the check-in clerk informs me
that I am not entitled to them. In January, on a flight to Australia —
a flight for which I was going to get about a zillion air miles — the
clerk shook her head when I presented my card and told me I
was not entitled to any.

“Why?”
“The ticket is in the name of B. Bryson and the card is in
the name of W. Bryson.”
I explained to her the close and venerable relationship
between Bill and William, but she wouldn’t have it.
So I didn’t get my air miles, and I won’t be flying to Bali
first class just yet. Perhaps just as well, really. I could never
go that long without eating.

T HINK A BOUT I T

1. Bill Bryson says, “I am, in short, easily confused.” What
examples has he given to justify this?
2. What happens when the zip on his carry-on bag gives way?
3. Why is his finger bleeding? What is his wife’s reaction?
4. How does Bill Bryson end up in a “crash position” in the aircraft?
5. Why are his teeth and gums navy blue?
6. Bill Bryson “ached to be suave”. Is he successful in his mission? List his ‘unsuave’ ways.
7. Why do you think Bill Bryson’s wife says to the children,
“Take the lids off the food for Daddy”?
8. What is the significance of the title?

To get confused and behave in ‘unsuave’ ways like Bill Bryson is
normal and human. Tell your class about any similar situation
that you found yourself in.
