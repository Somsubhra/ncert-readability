Why?
I know a curious little boy,
Who is always asking “Why?”
Why this, why that, why then, why now?
Why not, why by-the-by?

He wants to know why wood should swim,
Why lead and marble sink,
Why sun should shine and wind should blow
And why we eat and drink.
He wants to know what makes the clouds
And why they cross the sky,
Why sinks the sun behind the hills
And why the flowers die.
Some of these why’s are not too hard
To answer if you’ll try;
Others no one ever yet
Has found the reason why.

Let’s sing

The Man in an Onion Bed
I met a man in an onion bed.
He was crying so hard his eyes were red.
And the tears rolled off the end of his nose
As he ate his way down the onion rows.
He ate and he cried, but for all his tears
He sang, “Sweet onions, oh my dears!
I love you, I do and you love me,
But you make me as sad as a man can be.”

Alice in Wonderland
One day, Alice was lying under a tree listening to her
sister reading a story.
Suddenly, she saw a white rabbit scamper by. He
had pink eyes and was wearing a blue coat. He took
out a big watch from his waistcoat pocket and as he
hurried away, he said, “Oh dear, I will be too late!”
She thought there was something very different
about this rabbit. It could talk, it wore a red
waistcoat and it carried a watch.
Alice wondered, “A talking
rabbit? A rabbit who wears a
waistcoat!” Alice was burning with
curiosity and she followed the
white rabbit.

The rabbit started running and Alice followed the
rabbit. The rabbit suddenly popped down a large
rabbit hole. Alice jumped into the rabbit hole too! The
rabbit went down and down and down and down into
the rabbit hole.
Alice said aloud, “Where am
I? How many miles down
have I fallen? I must be
getting somewhere
near the centre of
the earth.” She
wondered, “Will I slip
through the earth to
the other side?”
Thump! Alice landed
on a pile of dry leaves.
She looked around
quickly and suddenly saw
the white rabbit again. It
disappeared saying, “Oh, my
ears and whiskers! How late it’s
getting!”
Alice stood up and saw a small
door about fifteen inches high. It was
too small for her to go through.
She saw a glass table with a golden

key on it. She tried the
little golden key in the
lock and to her
delight it fitted!
Alice opened the
door and looked
into the loveliest
garden she had
ever seen! How
she longed to be
among those
beds of bright
flowers and those
cool fountains! But
she could not even get her head through the doorway.
“Oh! How I wish, I could become smaller!” she
exclaimed loudly.

Along with the text, children can be encouraged to read/enact ‘Alice in
Wonderland’ and other fairy tales. Through the use of words the child can let
his friends see the wonderful stories and poems he invents in his mind.
Sharing time

Talk about curiosity with children. Ask them questions related to what they are
curious about? Interested in? Where do they experience most things?
Answer the various questions that they would like to ask.

Tell them other stories related to curious things in the world. Tell them to read
the newspapers and talk about important events. In what areas do they get
their best ideas?
Creative time

An environment that is laced with the child’s freedom to express how he thinks
the world can be encouraged by any medium that she/he chooses, e.g.,
through role play, (e.g: What do you want to be? Why?) Aesthetics (e.g.,
creating rhymes, music, art, craft… ).
Language corner

Use of dictionary in the classroom is very important. It will encourage the
students to increase their vocabulary and understand different words. The
teacher can use the mother tongue to explain difficult words and ask them to
make sentences of their own.

Environment
Vermiculture is a simple, efficient and environmental friendly technique to
decompose organic waste into valuable organic manure. Help from the local
school gardener can be taken.
