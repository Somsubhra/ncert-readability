A Happy Child

Enjoy this poem
My house is red - a little house;
A happy child am I.
I laugh and play the whole day long,
I hardly ever cry.

I have a tree, a green, green tree,
To shade me from the sun;
And under it I often sit,
When all my play is done.

One day a big bad wolf came to Sonu’s house.
He said, “I will huff and puff and I will blow your
house down.” So he huffed and he
puffed and he blew the house
down.
Sonu ran to Monu’s house.
The wolf came to Monu’s
house. He said, “I will huff and
puff and I will blow your
house down.” So he huffed and
he puffed and he blew Monu’s house down.

The wolf came to Gonu’s house. He said, “I will huff and

puffed but he could not blow the brick house down. It was
very strong.
The wolf went away and
Sonu, Monu and Gonu

Poem — A Happy Child
Story — Three Little Pigs

UNIT

1

Teacher's Pages

The emphasis in this book is on developing language skills by using the
mother tongue in the initial stages. The teacher’s encouragement and
motivation are very important. Children are curious and love to try things in
their own little ways. Do not correct their mistakes. Focus on the process of
learning and remember that the child needs to be given activities that are
exciting and stimulating.
The first Unit is about introducing the child to a process of learning
following the concept ‘from near to far’. Allow them to talk and help them to
express their thoughts by use of their mother tongue, visuals, pictures,
sketches, single word questions and answers. As you introduce the text
(both the poem and the story), encourage all the children to participate.

4
Develop listening skills
Read the poem/story aloud to the children.
Read it with emphasis on clear speech and correct pauses at commas
and full stops.
4
Develop pronunciation
Let the children read aloud after you. Make them repeat
blow, flow, glow

brick, kick, stick

huff, puff, stuff

4
Exposure to language
Use sight words in the classroom by putting visuals and cue cards.
Let children read these:
bad

bed

big

cot

bun

sad

red

dig

hot

sun

Develop speaking skills
1. Encourage children to walk and jump like different animals.
Let them make the sounds of ‘huff’, ‘puff'’ etc. with force.
2. Write two-letter words on the blackboard such as am, he, in, is, it,
me, my, so and start a contextual conversation by saying, ‘She is a
girl’, ‘I am a teacher’, ‘Please give me a pencil’, ‘He is a boy’, ‘You are
so far away’, ‘It is a warm/cold day’ etc.
Provide opportunities to children for working and playing together in

14

small groups. It will promote interaction, togetherness and team spirit
besides encouragement for natural expressions.
3. Conversation based on ‘Role play’
Divide your class into four groups: Red , Yellow , Blue , Green
l
Let each group make a house.
l
Red— a hut Blue— a flat Yellow— a bungalow Green—
an igloo
Red and Blue groups have to talk about all the objects in their
houses.
Yellow and Green groups have to
MATERIAL REQUIRED
talk about objects around their
houses.
Method— Each group uses lowl
Boxes/old cartons
c o s t w a s t e m a t e r i a l ( e . g . for collecting leaves, twigs...
newspapers, cardboard, grass,
Pencils / spoons, beads,
leaves, matchsticks, etc.) to
string etc.
draw, sketch, construct or act
out a scene from their house.

Develop writing skills / fine motor coordination
4

Writing needs practice before it becomes spontaneous and neat. In
making the strokes show the child how to hold the pencil and use it
safely. Encourage children to make different patterns/basic strokes by
drawing them on the blackboard, slate/paper. Put two letter and three
letter words on flash cards and show them to the children. Let them
recognise the words.
Raising awareness
4
Talk about turning off taps and not wasting water.
