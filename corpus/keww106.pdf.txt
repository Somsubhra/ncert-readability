I left India in 1964 with a certificate in commerce and the
equivalent, in those days, of ten dollars to my name. For
three weeks I sailed on the SS Roma, an Italian cargo vessel,
in a third-class cabin next to the ship’s engine, across the
Arabian Sea, the Red Sea, the Mediterranean and, finally,
to England. I lived in north London, in Finsbury Park, in a
house occupied entirely by penniless Bengali bachelors like
myself, at least a dozen and sometimes more, all struggling
to educate and establish ourselves abroad.
I attended lectures at the LSE and worked at the
university library to get by. We lived three or four to a
room, shared a single, icy toilet, and took turns cooking
pots of egg curry, which we ate with our hands on a table
covered with newspapers. Apart from our jobs we had few
responsibilities. On weekends we lounged barefoot in
drawstring pyjamas, drinking tea and smoking Rothmans,
or set out to watch cricket at Lord’s. Some weekends the
house was crammed with still more Bengalis to whom we
had introduced ourselves at the greengrocer or on the Tube,
and we made yet more egg curry, and played Mukesh on a
Grundig reel-to-reel, and soaked our dirty dishes in the
bathtub. Every now and then someone in the house moved
out to live with a woman whom his family back in Calcutta
had determined he was to wed. In 1969, when I was thirty-

six years old, my own marriage was arranged. Around the
same time, I was offered a full-time job in America, in the
processing department of a library at MIT. The salary was
generous enough to support a wife, and I was honoured to
be hired by a world-famous university, and so I obtained a
sixth-preference green card and prepared to travel farther
still.
By now I had enough money to go by plane. I flew first
to Calcutta, to attend my wedding, and a week later I flew
first to Boston, to begin my new job. During the flight I
read The Student Guide to North America, a paperback volume
that I’d bought before leaving London, for seven shillings
six pence on Tottenham Court Road for, although I was no
longer a student, I was on a budget all the same. I learned
that Americans drove on the right side of the road, not the
left, and that they called a lift an elevator and an engaged
phone busy. ‘The pace of life in North America is different
from Britain as you will soon discover,’ the guidebook
informed me. ‘Everybody feels he must get to the top. Don’t
expect an English cup of tea.’ As the plane began its descent
over Boston Harbour, the pilot announced the weather and
time, and that President Nixon had declared a national
holiday: two American men had landed on the moon.
Several passengers cheered. ‘God bless America!’ one of
them hollered. Across the aisle, I saw a woman praying.
I spent my first night at the YMCA in Central Square,
Cambridge, an inexpensive accommodation recommended
by my guidebook. It was walking distance from MIT, and
steps away from the post office and a supermarket called
Purity Supreme. The room contained a cot, a desk and a
small wooden cross on one wall. A sign on the door said
cooking was strictly forbidden. A bare window overlooked
Massachusetts Avenue, a major thoroughfare with traffic
in both directions. Car horns, shrill and prolonged, blared
one after another. Flashing sirens heralded endless
emergencies and a fleet of buses rumbled past, their doors
opening and closing with a powerful hiss, throughout the
night. The noise was constantly distracting, at times
suffocating. I felt it deep in my ribs, just as I had felt the
furious drone of the engine on the SS Roma. But there was

no ship’s deck to escape to, no glittering ocean to thrill my
soul, no breeze to cool my face, no one to talk to. I was too
tired to pace the gloomy corridors of the YMCA in my
drawstring pyjamas. Instead I sat at the desk and stared
out the window, at the city hall of Cambridge and a row of
small shops. In the morning I reported to my job at the
Dewey Library, a beige fortlike building by Memorial Drive.
I also opened a bank account, rented a post office box, and
bought a plastic bowl and a spoon at Woolworth’s, a store
whose name I recognised from London. I went to Purity
Supreme, wandering up and down the aisles, converting
ounces to grams and comparing prices to things in England.
In the end I bought a small carton of milk and a box of
cornflakes. This was my first meal in America. I ate it at
my desk. I preferred it to hamburgers or hot dogs, the only
alternative I could afford in the coffee shops on
Massachusetts Avenue, and, besides, at the time I had yet
to consume any beef. Even the simple chore of buying milk
was new to me; in London we’d had bottles delivered each
morning to our door.
In a week I had adjusted, more or less. I ate cornflakes
and milk, morning and night, and bought some bananas
for variety, slicing them into the bowl with the edge of my
spoon. In addition I bought tea bags and a flask, which the
salesman in Woolworth’s referred to as a thermos (a flask,
he informed me, was used to store whiskey, another thing
I had never consumed). For the price of one cup of tea at a
coffee shop, I filled the flask with boiling water on my way
to work each morning, and brewed the four cups I drank in
the course of a day. I bought a larger carton of milk, and
learned to leave it on the shaded part of the windowsill, as
I had seen another resident at the YMCA do. To pass the
time in the evenings I read the Boston Globe downstairs, in
a spacious room with stained glass windows. I read every
article and advertisement so that I would grow familiar
with things and, when my eyes grew tired, I slept. Only I
did not sleep well. Each night I had to keep the window
wide open; it was the only source of air in the stifling room,
and the noise was intolerable. I would lie on the cot with
my fingers pressed into my ears but when I drifted off to

sleep, my hands fell away and the noise of the traffic would
wake me up again. Pigeon feathers drifted onto the windowsill and, one evening, when I poured milk over my
cornflakes, I saw that it had soured. Nevertheless I resolved
to stay at the YMCA for six weeks, until my wife’s passport
and green card were ready. Once she arrived I would have
to rent a proper apartment and so, from time to time, I
studied the classified section of the newspaper, or stopped
in at the housing office at MIT during my lunch-break, to
see what was available in my price range. It was in this
manner that I discovered a room, for immediate occupancy,
in a house on a quiet street, the listing said, for eight
dollars per week. I copied the number into my guidebook
and dialled from a pay telephone, sorting through the coins
with which I was still unfamiliar, smaller and lighter than
shillings, heavier and brighter than paisas.
‘Who is speaking?’ a woman demanded. Her voice was
bold and clamorous.
‘Yes, good afternoon, madame. I am calling about the
room, for rent.’
‘Harvard or Tech?’
‘I beg your pardon?’
‘Are you from Harvard or Tech?’
Gathering that Tech referred to the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, I replied, ‘I work at Dewey Library’,
adding tentatively, ‘at Tech’.
I was given an address and an appointment for seven
o’clock that evening. Thirty minutes before the hour I set
out, my guidebook in my pocket, my breath fresh with
Listerine. I turned down a street shaded with trees,
perpendicular to Massachusetts Avenue. Stray blades of
grass poked between the cracks of the footpath. In spite of
the heat I wore a coat and a tie, regarding the event as I
would any other interview; I had never lived in the home of
a person who was not Indian. The house, surrounded by a
chain-link fence, was off-white with dark brown trim.
Unlike the stucco row house I’d lived in, in London, this
house, fully detached, was covered with wooded shingles,
with a tangle of forsythia bushes plastered against the
front and sides. When I pressed the calling bell, the woman

with whom I had spoken on the phone hollered from what
seemed to be just the other side of the door, ‘One minute
please!’
Several minutes later the door was opened by a tiny,
extremely old woman. A mass of snowy hair was arranged
like a small sack on top of her head. As I stepped into the
house, she sat down on a wooden bench positioned at the
bottom of a narrow carpeted staircase. Once she was settled
on the bench, in a small pool of light, she peered up at me
with undivided attention. She wore a long black skirt that
spread like a stiff tent to the floor, and a starched white
shirt edged with ruffles at the throat and cuffs. Her hands,
folded together in her lap, had long pallid fingers, with
swollen knuckles and tough yellow nails. Age had battered
her features so that she almost resembled a man, with
sharp, shrunken eyes and prominent creases on either side
of her nose. Her lips, chapped and faded, had nearly
disappeared, and her eyebrows were missing altogether.
Nevertheless she looked fierce.
‘Look up!’ she commanded. She shouted even though I
stood only a few feet away. ‘Fasten the chain and firmly
press that button on the knob! This is the first thing you
shall do when you enter, is that clear?’
I locked the door as directed and examined the house.
Next to the bench on which the woman sat was a small
round table, its legs fully concealed, much like the woman’s,
by a skirt of lace. The table held a lamp, a transistor radio,
a leather change purse with a silver clasp and a telephone.
A thick wooden cane coated with a layer of dust was propped
against one side. There was a parlour to my right, lined
with bookcases and filled with shabby claw-footed furniture.
In the corner of the parlour I saw a grand piano with its
top down, piled with papers. The piano’s bench was missing;
it seemed to be the one on which the woman was sitting.
Somewhere in the house a clock chimed seven times.
‘You’re punctual!’ the woman proclaimed. ‘ I expect you
shall be so with the rent!’
‘I have a letter, madame.’ In my jacket pocket was a
letter confirming my employment from MIT, which I had
brought along to prove that I was indeed from Tech.

She stared at the letter, then handed it back to me
carefully, gripping it with her fingers as if it were a dinner
plate heaped with food instead of a sheet of paper. She did
not wear glasses and I wondered if she’d read a word of it.
‘The last boy was always late! Still owes me eight dollars!
Harvard boys aren’t what they used to be! Only Harvard
and Tech in this house! How’s Tech, boy?’
‘It is very well.’
‘You checked the lock?’
‘Yes, madame.’
She slapped the space beside her on the bench with
one hand and told me to sit down. For a moment she was
silent. Then she intoned, as if she alone possessed this
knowledge:
‘There is an American flag on the moon!’
‘Yes, madame.’ Until then I had not thought very much
about the moon shot. It was in the newspaper, of course,
article upon article. The astronauts had landed on the
shores of the Sea of Tranquillity, I had read, travelling
farther than anyone in the history of civilization. For a few
hours they explored the moon’s surface. They gathered rocks
in their pockets, described their surroundings (a
magnificent desolation, according to one astronaut), spoke
by phone to the President and planted a flag in lunar soil.
The voyage was hailed as man’s most awesome achievement.
I had seen full-page photographs in the Globe, of the
astronauts in their inflated costumes, and read about what
certain people in Boston had been doing at the exact moment
the astronauts landed, on a Sunday afternoon. A man said
that he was operating a swan boat with a radio pressed to
his ear; a woman had been baking rolls for her
grandchildren.
The woman bellowed, ‘A flag on the moon, boy! I heard
it on the radio! Isn’t that splendid?’
‘Yes, madame.’
But she was not satisfied with my reply. Instead she
commanded, ‘Say ‘splendid’!’
I was both baffled and somewhat insulted by the
request. It reminded me of the way I was taught
multiplication tables as a child, repeating after the master,

sitting cross-legged, without shoes or pencils, on the floor
of my one-room Tollygunge school. It also reminded me of
my wedding when I had repeated endless Sanskrit verses
after the priest, verses I barely understood, which joined
me to my wife. I said nothing.
‘Say ‘splendid’!’ the woman bellowed once again.
‘Splendid,’ I murmured. I had to repeat the word a
second time at the top of my lungs so she could hear. I am
soft-spoken by nature and was especially reluctant to raise
my voice to an elderly woman whom I had met only moments
ago, but she did not appear to be offended. If anything the
reply pleased her because her next command was:
‘Go see the room!’
I rose from the bench and mounted the narrow carpeted
staircase. There were five doors, two on either side of an
equally narrow hallway and one at the opposite end. Only
one door was partly open. The room contained a twin bed
under a sloping ceiling, a brown oval rug, a basin with an
exposed pipe, and a chest of drawers. One door, painted
white, led to a closet, another to a toilet and a tub. The
walls were covered with gray and ivory striped paper. The
window was open; net curtains stirred in the breeze. I lifted
them away and inspected the view: a small backyard, with
a few fruit trees and an empty clothesline. I was satisfied.
From the bottom of the stairs I heard the woman demand,
‘What is your decision?’
When I returned to the foyer and told her, she picked
up the leather change purse on the table, opened the clasp,
fished about with her fingers, and produced a key on a
thin wire hoop. She informed me that there was a kitchen
at the back of the house, accessible through the parlour. I
was welcome to use the stove as long as I left it as I found
it. Sheets and towels were provided but keeping them clean
was my own responsibility. The rent was due Friday
mornings on the ledge above the piano keys. ‘And no lady
visitors!’
‘I am a married man, madame.’ It was the first time I
had announced this fact to anyone.
But she had not heard. ‘No lady visitors!’ she insisted.
She introduced herself as Mrs Croft.

My wife’s name was Mala. The marriage had been
arranged by my older brother and his wife. I regarded the
proposition with neither objection nor enthusiasm. It was
a duty expected of me as it was expected of every man. She
was the daughter of a school teacher in Beleghata. I was
told that she could cook, knot, embroider, sketch landscapes
and recite poems by Tagore, but these talents could not
make up for the fact that she did not possess a fair
complexion and so a string of men had rejected her to her
face. She was twenty-seven, an age when her parents had
begun to fear that she would never marry, and so they
were willing to ship their only child halfway across the
world in order to save her from spinsterhood.
For five nights we shared a bed. Each of those nights,
after applying cold cream and braiding her hair, which she
tied up at the end with a black cotton string, she turned
from me and wept; she missed her parents. Although I
would be leaving the country in a few days, custom dictated
that she was now a part of my household, and for the next
six weeks she was to live with my brother and his wife,
cooking, cleaning, serving tea and sweets to guests. I did
nothing to console her. I lay on my own side of the bed,
reading my guidebook by flashlight and anticipating my
journey. At times I thought of the tiny room on the other
side of the wall which had belonged to my mother. Now the
room was practically empty; the wooden pallet on which
she’d once slept was piled with trunks and old bedding.
Nearly six years ago, before leaving for London, I had watched
her die on that bed, had found her playing with her
excrement in her final days. Before we cremated her I had
cleaned each of her fingernails with a hairpin and then,
because my brother could not bear it, I had assumed the
role of eldest son, and had touched the flame to her temple,
to release her tormented soul to heaven.
The next morning I moved into the room in Mrs Croft’s
house. When I unlocked the door, I saw that she was sitting
on the piano bench, on the same side as the previous
evening. She wore the same black skirt, the same starched
white blouse and had her hands folded together the same
way in her lap. She looked so much the same that I wondered

if she’d spent the whole night on the bench. I put my suitcase
upstairs, filled my flask with boiling water in the kitchen,
and headed off to work. That evening when I came home
from the university, she was still there.
‘Sit down, boy!’ She slapped the space beside her.
I perched beside her on the bench. I had a bag of
groceries with me—more milk, more cornflakes and more
bananas, for, my inspection of the kitchen earlier in the
day had revealed no spare pots, pans, or cooking utensils.
There were only two saucepans in the refrigerator, both
containing some orange broth, and a copper kettle on the
stove.
‘Good evening, madame.’
She asked me if I had checked the lock. I told her I
had.
For a moment she was silent. Then suddenly she
declared, with equal measures of disbelief and delight as
the night before, ‘There’s an American flag on the moon,
boy!’
‘Yes, madame.’
‘A flag on the moon! Isn’t that splendid?’
I nodded, dreading what I knew was coming. ‘Yes,
madame.’
‘Say ‘splendid’!’
This time I paused, looking to either side in case anyone
were there to overhear me, though I knew perfectly well
that the house was empty. I felt like an idiot. But is was a
small enough thing to ask. ‘splendid!’ I cried out.
Within days it became our routine. In the mornings,
when I left for the library, Mrs Croft was either hidden
away in her bedroom, on the other side of the staircase, or
she was sitting on the bench, oblivious to my presence,
listening to the news or classical music on the radio. But
each evening when I returned the same thing happened:
she slapped the bench, ordered me to sit down, declared
that there was a flag on the moon, and declared that it was
splendid. I said it was splendid, too, and then we sat in
silence. As awkward as it was, and as endless as it felt to
me then, the nightly encounter lasted only about ten
minutes; inevitably she would drift off to sleep, her head

falling abruptly toward her chest, leaving me free to retire
to my room. By then, of course, there was no flag on the
moon. The astronauts, I had read in the paper, had taken
it down before flying back to earth. But I did not have the
heart to tell her.
Friday morning, when my first week’s rent was due, I
went to the piano in the parlour to place my money on the
ledge. The piano keys were dull and discoloured. When I
pressed one, it made no sound at all. I had put eight onedollar bills in an envelope and written Mrs Croft’s name on
the front of it; I was not in the habit of leaving money
unmarked and unattended. From where I stood I could see
the profile of her tent-shaped skirt. She was sitting on the
bench, listening to the radio. It seemed unnecessary to
make her get up and walk all the way to the piano. I never
saw her walking about and assumed, from the cane always
propped against the round table at her side, that she did
so with difficulty. When I approached the bench, she peered
up at me and demanded:
‘What is your business?’
‘The rent, madame.’
‘On the ledge above the piano keys!’
‘I have it here.’ I extended the envelope toward her, but
her fingers, folded together in her lap, did not budge. I
bowed slightly and lowered the envelope, so that it hovered
just above her hands. After a moment she accepted, and
nodded her head.
That night when I came home, she did not slap the
bench but out of habit I sat beside her as usual. She asked
me if I had checked the lock but she mentioned nothing
about the flag on the moon. Instead she said:
‘It was very kind of you!’
‘I beg your pardon, madame?’
‘Very kind of you!’
She was still holding the envelope in her hands.
On Sunday there was a knock on my door. An elderly
woman introduced herself: she was Mrs Croft’s daughter,
Helen. She walked into the room and looked at each of the
walls as if for signs of change, glancing at the shirts that
hung in the closet, the neckties draped over the doorknob,

the box of cornflakes on the chest of drawers, the dirty
bowl and spoon in the basin. She was short and thickwaisted, with cropped silver hair and bright pink lipstick.
She wore a sleeveless summer dress, a row of white plastic
beads and spectacles on a chain that hung like a swing
against her chest. The backs of her legs were mapped with
dark blue veins and her upper arms sagged like the flesh
of a roasted eggplant. She told me she lived in Arlington, a
town farther up Massachusetts Avenue. ‘I come once a week
to bring Mother groceries. Has she sent you packing yet?’
‘It is very well, madame.’
‘Some of the boys run screaming. But I think she likes
you. You’re the first boarder she’s ever referred to as a
gentleman.’
‘Not at all, madame.’
She looked at me, noticing my bare feet (I still felt
strange wearing shoes indoors, and always removed them
before entering my room). ‘Are you new to Boston?’
‘New to America, madame.’
‘From?’ She raised her eyebrows.
‘I am from Calcutta, India.’
‘Is that right? We had a Brazilian fellow, about a year
ago. You’ll find Cambridge a very international city.’
I nodded, and began to wonder how long our
conversation would last. But at that moment we heard
Mrs Croft’s electrifying voice rising up the stairs. When we
stepped into the hallway we heard her hollering:
‘You are to come downstairs immediately!’
‘What is it?’ Helen hollered back.
‘Immediately!’
I put on my shoes at once. Helen sighed.
We walked down the staircase. It was too narrow for
us to descend side by side, so I followed Helen, who seemed
to be in no hurry, and complained at one point that she
had a bad knee. ‘Have you been walking without your cane?’
Helen called out. ‘You know you’re not supposed to walk
without that cane.’ She paused, resting her hand on the
banister, and looked back at me. ‘She slips sometimes.’
For the first time Mrs Croft seemed vulnerable. I
pictured her on the floor in front of the bench, flat on her

back, staring at the ceiling, her feet pointing in opposite
directions. But when we reached the bottom of the staircase
she was sitting there as usual, her hands folded together
in her lap. Two grocery bags were at her feet. When we
stood before her she did not slap the bench, or ask us to sit
down. She glared.
‘What is it, Mother?’
‘It’s improper!’
‘What’s improper?’
‘It is improper for a lady and gentleman who are not
married to one another to hold a private conversation
without a chaperone!’
Helen said she was sixty-eight years old, old enough to
be my mother, but Mrs Croft insisted that Helen and I
speak to each other downstairs, in the parlour. She added
that it was also improper for a lady of Helen’s station to
reveal her age, and to wear a dress so high above the ankle.
‘For your information, Mother, it’s 1969. What would
you do if you actually left the house one day and saw a girl
in a miniskirt?’
Mrs Croft sniffed, ‘I’d have her arrested.’
Helen shook her head and picked up one of the grocery
bags. I picked up the other one and followed her through
the parlour and into the kitchen. The bags were filled with
cans of soup, which Helen opened up one by one with a few
cranks of a can opener. She tossed the old soup in the
saucepans into the sink, rinsed the pans under the tap,
filled them with soup from the newly opened cans, and put
them back in the refrigerator. ‘A few years ago she could
still open the cans herself,’ Helen said. ‘She hates that I do
it for her now. But the piano killed her hands.’ She put on
her spectacles, glanced at the cupboards, and spotted my
tea bags. ‘Shall we have a cup?’
I filled the kettle on the stove. ‘ I beg your pardon,
madame. The piano?’
‘She used to give lessons. For forty years. It was how
she raised us after my father died.’ Helen put her hands on
her hips, staring at the open refrigerator. She reached into
the back, pulled out a wrapped stick of butter, frowned,
and tossed it into the garbage. ‘That ought to do it,’ she

said, and put the unopened cans of soup in the cupboard. I
sat at the table and watched as Helen washed the dirty
dishes, tied up the garbage bag, watered a spider plant
over the sink, and poured boiling water into two cups. She
handed one to me without milk, the string of the tea bag
trailing over the side, and sat down at the table.
‘Excuse me, madame, but is it enough?’
Helen took a sip of her tea. Her lipstick left a smiling
pink stain on the inside rim of the cup. ‘Is what enough?’
‘The soup in the pans. Is it enough food for Mrs Croft?’
‘She won’t eat anything else. She stopped eating solids
after she turned one hundred. That was, let’s see, three
years ago.’
I was mortified. I had assumed Mrs Croft was in her
eighties, perhaps as old as ninety. I had never known a
person who had lived for over a century. That this person
was a widow who lived alone mortified me further still. It
was widowhood that had driven my own mother insane.
My father, who worked as a clerk at the General Post Office
of Calcutta, died of encephalitis when I was sixteen. My
mother refused to adjust to life without him; instead, she
sank deeper into a world of darkness from which neither I,
nor my brother, nor concerned relatives, nor psychiatric
clinics on Rashbihari Avenue could save her. What pained
me most was to see her so unguarded, to hear her burp
after meals or expel gas in front of company without the
slightest embarrassment. After my father’s death my brother
abandoned his schooling and began to work in the jute
mill he would eventually manage, in order to keep the
household running. And so it was my job to sit by my
mother’s feet and study for my exams as she counted and
recounted the bracelets on her arm as if they were the
beads of an abacus. We tried to keep an eye on her. Once
she had wandered half naked to the tram depot before we
were able to bring her inside again.
‘I am happy to warm Mrs Croft’s soup in the evenings,’
I suggested, removing the tea bag from my cup and
squeezing out the liquor. ‘It is no trouble.’
Helen looked at her watch, stood up, and poured
the rest of her tea into the sink. ‘I wouldn’t if I

were you. That’s the sort of thing that would kill
her altogether.’
That evening, when Helen had gone back to Arlington
and Mrs Croft and I were alone again, I began to worry.
Now that I knew how very old she was, I worried that
something would happen to her in the middle of the night,
or when I was out during the day. As vigorous as her voice
was, and imperious as she seemed, I knew that even a
scratch or a cough could kill a person that old; each day
she lived, I knew, was something of a miracle. Although
Helen had seemed friendly enough, a small part of me
worried that she might accuse me of negligence if anything
were to happen. Helen didn’t seem worried. She came and
went, bringing soup for Mrs Croft, one Sunday after the
next.
In this manner the six weeks of that summer passed. I
came home each evening, after my hours at the library,
and spent a few minutes on the piano bench with Mrs
Croft. I gave her a bit of my company, and assured her that
I had checked the lock, and told her that the flag on the
moon was splendid. Some evenings I sat beside her long
after she had drifted off to sleep, still in awe of how many
years she had spent on this earth. At times I tried to picture
the world she had been born into, in 1866—a world, I
imagined, filled with women in long black skirts and chaste
conversations in the parlour. Now when I looked at her
hands with their swollen knuckles folded together in her
lap, I imagined them smooth and slim, striking the piano
keys. At times I came downstairs, before going to sleep, to
make sure that she was sitting upright on the bench, or
was safe in her bedroom. On Fridays I made sure to put
the rent in her hands. There was nothing I could do for her
beyond these simple gestures. I was not her son and apart
from those eight dollars, I owed her nothing.
At the end of August, Mala’s passport and green card
were ready. I received a telegram with her flight information;
my brother’s house in Calcutta had no telephone. Around
that time I also received a letter from her, written only a few
days after we had parted. There was no salutation; addressing
me by name would have assumed an intimacy we had not

yet discovered. It contained only a few lines. ‘I write in English
in preparation for the journey. Here I am very much lonely. Is
it very cold there. Is there snow. Yours, Mala.’
I was not touched by her words. We had spent only a
handful of days in each other’s company. And yet we were
bound together; for six weeks she had worn an iron bangle
on her wrist, and applied vermilion powder to the part in
her hair, to signify to the world that she was a bride. In
those six weeks I regarded her arrival as I would the arrival
of a coming month, or season—something inevitable but
meaningless at the time. So little did I know her that, while
details of her face sometimes rose to my memory, I could
not conjure up the whole of it.
A few days after receiving the letter, as I was walking
to work in the morning, I saw an Indian woman on the
other side of Massachusetts Avenue, wearing a sari with
its free end nearly dragging on the footpath, and pushing a
child in a stroller. An American woman with a small black
dog on a leash was walking to one side of her. Suddenly the
dog began barking. From the other side of the street I
watched as the Indian woman, startled, stopped in her
path, at which point the dog leapt up and seized the end of
the sari between its teeth. The American woman scolded
the dog, appeared to apologise, and walked quickly away,
leaving the Indian woman to fix her sari in the middle of
the footpath, and quiet her crying child. She did not see
me standing there and eventually she continued on her
way. Such a mishap, I realised that morning, would soon
be my concern. It was my duty to take care of Mala, to
welcome her and protect her. I would have to buy her her
first pair of snow boots, her first winter coat. I would have
to tell her which streets to avoid, which way the traffic
came, tell her to wear her sari so that the free end did not
drag on the footpath. A five-mile separation from her
parents, I recalled with some irritation, had caused her to
weep.
Unlike Mala, I was used to it all by then: used to
cornflakes and milk, used to Helen’s visits, used to sitting
on the bench with Mrs Croft. The only thing I was not used
to was Mala. Nevertheless I did what I had to do. I went to

the housing office at MIT and found a furnished apartment
a few blocks away, with a double bed and a private kitchen
and bath, for forty dollars a week. One last Friday I handed
Mrs Croft eight one-dollar bills in an envelope, brought my
suitcase downstairs, and informed her that I was moving.
She put my key into her change purse. The last thing she
asked me to do was to hand her the cane propped against
the table so that she could walk to the door and lock it
behind me. ‘Good-bye, then,’ she said, and retreated back
into the house. I did not expect any display of emotion but
I was disappointed all the same. I was only a boarder, a
man who paid her a bit of money and passed in and out of
her home for six weeks. Compared to a century, it was no
time at all.
At the airport I recognised Mala immediately. The free
end of her sari did not drag on the floor but was draped in
a sign of bridal modesty over her head, just as it had draped
my mother until the day my father died. Her thin brown
arms were stacked with gold bracelets, a small red circle
was painted on her forehead and the edges of her feet were
tinted with a decorative red dye. I did not embrace her, or
kiss her, or take her hand. Instead I asked her, speaking
Bengali for the first time in America, if she was hungry.
I told her I had prepared some egg curry at home. ‘What
did they give you to eat on the plane?’
‘I didn’t eat.’
‘All the way from Calcutta?’
‘The menu said oxtail soup.’
‘But surely there were other items.’
‘The thought of eating an ox’s tail made me lose my
appetite.’
When we arrived home, Mala opened up one of her
suitcases and presented me with two pullover sweaters,
both made with bright blue wool, which she had knitted in
the course of our separation, one with a V neck, the other
covered with cables. I tried them on; both were tight under
the arms. She had also brought me two new pairs of
drawstring pyjamas, a letter from my brother and a packet
of loose Darjeeling tea. I had no present for her apart from
the egg curry. We sat at a bare table, each of us staring at

our plates. We ate with our hands, another thing I had not
yet done in America.
‘The house is nice,’ she said, ‘also the egg curry’. With
her left hand she held the end of her sari to her chest, so it
would not slip off her head.
‘I don’t know many recipes.’
She nodded, peeling the skin off each of her potatoes
before eating them. At one point the sari slipped to her
shoulders. She readjusted it at once.
‘There is no need to cover your head,’ I said. ‘I don’t
mind. It doesn’t matter here.’
She kept it covered anyway.
I waited to get used to her, to her presence at my side,
at my table and in my bed, but a week later we were still
strangers. I still was not used to coming home to an
apartment that smelled of steamed rice, and finding that
the basin in the bathroom was always wiped clean, our
two toothbrushes lying side by side, a cake of Pears soap
from India resting in the soap dish. I was not used to the
fragrance of the coconut oil she rubbed every other night
into her scalp, or the delicate sound her bracelets made as
she moved about the apartment. In the mornings she was
always awake before I was. The first morning when I came
into the kitchen she had heated up the leftovers and set a
plate with a spoonful of salt on its edge on the table,
assuming I would eat rice for breakfast, as most Bengali
husbands did. I told her cereal would do and the next
morning when I came into the kitchen she had already
poured the cornflakes into my bowl. One morning she walked
with me down Massachusetts Avenue to MIT, where I gave
her a short tour of the campus. On the way we stopped at a
hardware store and I made a copy of the key, so that she
could let herself into the apartment. The next morning
before I left for work she asked me for a few dollars. I
parted with them reluctantly but I knew that this, too, was
now normal. When I came home from work there was a
potato peeler in the kitchen drawer, and a tablecloth on
the table, and chicken curry made with fresh garlic and
ginger on the stove. We did not have a television in those
days. After dinner I read the newspaper, while Mala sat at

the kitchen table, working on a cardigan for herself with
more of the bright blue wool, or writing letters home.
At the end of our first week, on Friday, I suggested
going out. Mala set down her knitting and disappeared
into the bathroom. When she emerged I regretted the
suggestion; she had put on a clean silk sari and extra
bracelets, and coiled her hair with a flattering side part on
top of her head. She was prepared as if for a party, or at
the very least for the cinema, but I had no such destination
in mind. The evening air was balmy. We walked several
blocks down Massachusetts Avenue, looking into the
windows of restaurants and shops. Then, without thinking,
I led her down the quiet street where for so many nights I
had walked alone.
‘This is where I lived before you came,’ I said, stopping
at Mrs Croft’s chain-link fence.
‘In such a big house?’
‘I had a small room upstairs. At the back.’
‘Who else lives there?’
‘A very old woman.’
‘With her family?’
‘Alone.’
‘But who takes care of her?’
I opened the gate. ‘For the most part she takes care of
herself.’
I wondered if Mrs Croft would remember me; I wondered
if she had a new boarder to sit with her on the bench each
evening. When I pressed the bell I expected the same long
wait as that day of our first meeting, when I did not have a
key. But this time the door was opened almost immediately,
by Helen. Mrs Croft was not sitting on the bench. The bench
was gone.
‘Hello there,’ Helen said, smiling with her bright pink
lips at Mala.
‘Mother’s in the parlour. Will you be visiting awhile?’
‘As you wish, madame.’
‘Then I think I’ll run to the store, if you don’t mind.
She had a little accident. We can’t leave her alone these
days, not even for a minute.’
I locked the door after Helen and walked into the

parlour. Mrs Croft was lying flat on her back, her head on
a peach-coloured cushion, a thin white quilt spread over
her body. Her hands were folded together on top of her
chest. When she saw me she pointed at the sofa and told
me to sit down. I took my place as directed but Mala
wandered over to the piano and sat on the bench which
was now positioned where it belonged.
‘I broke my hip! ’ Mrs Croft announced, as if no time
had passed.
‘Oh dear, madame.’
‘I fell off the bench!’
‘I am so sorry, madame.’
‘It was the middle of the night! Do you know what I
did, boy?’
I shook my head.
‘I called the police!’
She stared up at the ceiling and grinned sedately,
exposing a crowded row of long grey teeth. Not one was
missing. ‘What do you say to that, boy?’
As stunned as I was, I knew what I had to say.With no
hesitation at all, I cried out, ‘Splendid!’
Mala laughed then. Her voice was full of kindness, her
eyes bright with amusement. I had never heard her laugh
before, and it was loud enough so that Mrs Croft had heard,
too. She turned to Mala and glared.
‘Who is she, boy?’
‘She is my wife, madame.’
Mrs Croft pressed her head at an angle against the
cushion to get a better look, ‘Can you play the piano?’
‘No, madame,’ Mala replied.
‘Then stand up!’
Mala rose to her feet, adjusting the end of her sari
over her head and holding it to her chest, and, for the first
time since her arrival, I felt sympathy. I remembered my
first days in London, learning how to take the tube to Russell
Square, riding an escalator for the first time, being unable
to understand that when the man cried ‘piper’ it meant
‘paper’, being unable to decipher, for a whole year, that the
conductor said ‘mind the gap’ as the train pulled away
from each station. Like me, Mala had travelled far from

home. Not knowing where she was going, or what she would
find, for no reason other than to be my wife. As strange as
it seemed, I knew in my heart that one day her death would
affect me and, stranger still, that mine would affect her. I
wanted somehow to explain this to Mrs Croft, who was still
scrutinising Mala from top to toe with what seemed to be
placid disdain. I wondered if Mrs Croft had ever seen a
woman in a sari, with a dot painted on her forehead and
bracelets stacked on her wrists. I wondered what she would
object to. I wondered if she could see the red dye still vivid
on Mala’s feet, all but obscured by the bottom edge of her
sari. At last Mrs Croft declared, with equal measures of
disbelief and delight I knew well:
‘She is a perfect lady!’
Now it was I who laughed. I did so quietly and Mrs
Croft did not hear me. But Mala had heard, and, for the
first time, we looked at each other and smiled.
I like to think of that moment in Mrs Croft’s parlour as
the moment when the distance between Mala and me began
to lessen. Although we were not yet fully in love, I like to
think of the months that followed as a honeymoon of sorts.
Together we explored the city and met other Bengalis, some
of whom are still friends today. We discovered that a man
named Bill sold fresh fish on Prospect Street, and that a
shop in Harvard Square, called Cardullo’s, sold bay leaves
and cloves. In the evenings we walked to the Charles River
to watch sailboats drift across the water, or had ice cream
cones in Harvard Yard. We bought an Instamatic camera
with which to document our life together, and I took pictures
of her posing in front of the Prudential building so that she
could send them to her parents. At night we kissed, shy at
first but quickly bold, and discovered pleasure and solace
in each other’s arms. I told her about my voyage on the SS
Roma, and about Finsbury Park and the YMCA, and my
evenings on the bench with Mrs Croft. When I told her
stories about my mother, she wept. It was Mala who
consoled me when, reading the Globe one evening, I came
across Mrs Croft’s obituary. I had not thought of her in
several months—by then those six weeks of the summer
were already a remote interlude in my past—but when I

learned of her death I was stricken, so much so that when
Mala looked up from her knitting she found me staring at
the wall, the newspaper neglected in my lap, unable to
speak. Mrs Croft’s was the first death I mourned in America,
for, hers was the first life I had admired; she had left this
world at last, ancient and alone, never to return.
As for me, I have not strayed much farther: Mala and I
live in a town about twenty miles from Boston, on a treelined street much like Mrs Croft’s, in a house we own, with
a garden that saves us from buying tomatoes in summer,
and room for guests. We are American citizens now so that
we can collect social security when it is time. Though we
visit Calcutta every few years, and bring back more
drawstring pyjamas and Darjeeling tea, we have decided
to grow old here. I work in a small college library. We have
a son who attends Harvard University. Mala no longer
drapes the end of her sari over her head, or weeps at night
for her parents but, occasionally, she weeps for our son.
So we drive to Cambridge to visit him, or bring him home
for a weekend, so that he can eat rice with us with his
hands and speak in Bengali, things we sometimes worry
he will no longer do after we die.
Whenever we make that drive, I always make it a point
to take Massachusetts Avenue, in spite of the traffic. I
barely recognise the buildings now but each time I am
there I return instantly to those six weeks as if they were
only the other day, and I slow down and point to Mrs Croft’s
street, saying to my son, here was my first home in America
where I lived with a woman who was 103. ‘Remember?’
Mala says, and smiles, amazed, as I am, that there was
ever a time that we were strangers. My son always expresses
his astonishment, not at Mrs Croft’s age, but at how little I
paid in rent, a nearly inconceivable amount to him as a
flag on the moon was to a woman born in 1866. In my son’s
eyes I see the ambition that had first hurled me across the
world. In a few years he will graduate and pave his way,
alone and unprotected. But I remind myself that he has a
father who is still living, a mother who is happy and strong.
Whenever he is discouraged, I tell him that if I can survive
on three continents, then there is no obstacle he cannot

conquer. While the astronauts, heroes forever, spent mere
hours on the moon, I have remained in this new world for
nearly thirty years. I know that my achievement is quite
ordinary. I am not the only man to seek his fortune far
from home and certainly I am not the first. Still, there are
times I am bewildered by each mile I have travelled, each
meal I have eaten, each person I have known, each room in
which I have slept. As ordinary as it all appears, there are
times when it is beyond my imagination.
