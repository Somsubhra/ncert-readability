The Tailor and his Friend
Read and enjoy this story
Kalu the tailor had a shop near the river.
He made colourful pants and
shirts for children. Appu the
elephant was his
friend. Appu came to
his shop everyday.
Kalu gave him many
nice things to eat.
One day Kalu
wanted to play a
trick. He did not give
Appu anything to eat.
He took out his needle
instead and pricked Appu’s trunk. Appu ran away in pain.

Two days later
Appu came down to
the river and filled
his trunk with water.
He reached Kalu’s
shop and threw
water everywhere. All
the new clothes
became wet.
Appu shook his
trunk and said “An
elephant never forgets.”
Kalu said, “I am sorry,
Appu. Let’s be friends
again.”
Kalu and Appu became
good friends.

The emphasis in this Unit is on:
4
different occupations;
l
imaginative thinking and
l
the ability to write and speak sentences.
l
Children should be able to write sentences such as ‘My name is…’
There can be times when the children do not speak correctly.
Remember, the main focus is on communication and the ability of the
children to express their feelings in English.
4
Children can be given a series of oral directions to listen to and then
follow. Gradually increase the number of directions. For example:
Pat your head,
touch your nose,
pull your ear,
stamp your feet.
Encourage an independent reading and writing habit in children and
4
provide them time for it. Motivate them by reading interesting stories and
poems. Use the language for instruction that is familiar to the child. Let
your enthusiasm for the story shine through. Speak slowly and clearly.
4
Some thoughts on friendship, basic hygiene, and compassion for
animals, peace and sensitivity to their environment can be discussed.
4
Ask the children to practice the alphabets in lower case and capital
letters. By now the child should have an understanding of basic
punctuation like capital letters, full stops and question marks and be able
to recognise plural and singular forms. In all this, the key word is
encouragement. The child who senses your faith in his abilities will learn
to trust himself and derive satisfaction from his accomplishments and
stay motivated.
4
Role play and activities are vital for the development of the child.
Through these he/she learns to communicate verbally, share, take turns
and enjoy interaction with others.
4
This book attempts to involve the child in a sense of joy for a new
language. The child who is gently nurtured, subtly led and exposed to all
aspects of his environment is the child who will learn.
