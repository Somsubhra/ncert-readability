• Our body and brain recover from fatigue after a good sleep.
• We dream while sleeping, but we do not always remember
our dreams.
• During sleep, our heartbeat becomes slower and our temperature
and blood pressure go down.

WE know enough about what sleep is, though we don’t know
what exactly causes sleep. Sleep is a state of rest — an
unconscious rest. When we sleep, our body recovers from
fatigue caused by the day’s activities. After a good sleep and
the rest that it gives, we
become alert and active
again, ready for the normal
activities of the day.
When we wake up in
the morning, it is not
always possible for us to
remember what happened when we were
asleep. We may remember
a dream but the rest of
our sleep was a kind of
darkness in which
nothing seems to have
taken place.

26/A Pact with the Sun

Several things happen to our body while we are sleeping.
As we sink deeper into sleep, our muscles relax more and
more. Our heartbeat becomes slower. Our temperature and
blood pressure go down. The ever-active brain also slows
down so that we can’t think or act consciously. But we dream.
When we wake up, our temperature and blood pressure
rise to normal. Our heartbeat and breathing also become
normal and we are fully awake, and have forgotten most, if
not all, the dreams that we had while sleeping.

• A dream is an activity of the mind when we are asleep.
• Dreams help us sleep through noise and other disturbances.
• Dreams may reveal something about one’s problems, but they
cannot tell the future.

What is a dream? It is an activity of the mind that takes
place when we are asleep. Some dreams are probable
while others are not. That only means that many of the
things that happen in dreams could happen when we are
awake. Others could not. Dreams seem to be important
for several reasons. One is that a dream can help us to
sleep through noise or other disturbances. For example,
the alarm clock rings, but our mind causes us to dream
that the telephone or doorbell is ringing, and that we are
awake and answering it.
Certain doctors have found that one’s dreams often reveal a
great deal about one’s problems and that, if understood correctly,
they can provide a key to the solution of those problems. But
we must remember one thing. Dreams cannot be used as a way
to tell the future. They simply can never tell the future.
Sleep is the most common experience, but how many of
us really think about the wonder and power of sleep? Many

Lights Out

I have come to the borders of sleep,
The unfathomable deep
Forest where all must lose
Their way, however straight,
Or winding, soon or late;
They cannot choose.
There is not any book
Or face of dearest look
That I would not turn from now
To go into the unknown
I must enter and leave alone
I know not how.
