Before you read

Do you have a good memory? Has your memory ever
played any tricks on you?
Forgetfulness often puts you in a tight spot. But forgetting
a part of your life completely may drive you crazy. In this
story, Bepin Babu goes nearly crazy because he cannot
recollect his stay at Ranchi. He has never been to Ranchi,
he insists, though there are many witnesses to the
contrary. What is the suspense all about?

Every Monday, on his way back from work, Bepin
Choudhury would drop in at Kalicharan's in New Market
to buy books. Crime stories, ghost stories and thrillers.
He had to buy at least five at a time to last him through
the week. He lived alone, was not a good mixer, had few
friends, and didn’t like spending time in idle chat. Today,
at Kalicharan’s, Bepin Babu had the feeling that
someone was observing him from close quarters. He
turned round and found himself looking at a round
faced, meek looking man who now broke into a smile.
“I don’t suppose you recognise me.”
“Have we met before?” asked Bepin Babu.
The man looked greatly surprised. “We met every day for a
whole week. I arranged for a car to take you to the Hudroo falls.

In 1958. In Ranchi. My name is Parimal Ghose.”
“Ranchi?”
Now Bepin Babu realised that it was not he but this
man who was making a mistake. Bepin Babu had never
been to Ranchi. He had been at the point of going several
times, but never made it. He smiled and said, “Do you
know who I am?”
The man raised his eyebrows, bit his tongue and
said, “Do I know you? Who doesn’t know Bepin
Choudhury?”
Bepin Babu now turned towards the bookshelves and
said, “Still you’re making a mistake. One often does.
I’ve never been to Ranchi.”
The man now laughed aloud.
“What are you saying, Mr Choudhury? You had a
fall in Hudroo and cut your right knee. I brought you
iodine. I had fixed up a car for you to go to Netarhat the
next day, but you couldn’t because of the pain in the
knee. Can’t you recall anything? Someone else you know
was also in Ranchi at that time. Mr Dinesh Mukerji.
You stayed in a bungalow. You said you didn’t like hotel
food and would prefer to have your meals cooked by a

bawarchi. Mr Mukerji stayed with his sister. You had a
big argument about the moon landing, remember? I’ll
tell you more: you always carried a bag with your books
in it on your sight-seeing trips. Am I right or not?”
Bepin Babu spoke quietly, his eyes still on the books.
“Which month in ’58 are you talking about?”
The man said, “October.”
“No, sir,” said Bepin Babu. “I spent Puja in ’58 with
a friend in Kanpur. You’re making a mistake. Good day.”
But the man didn’t go, nor did he stop talking.
“Very strange. One evening I had tea with you in a
veranda of your bungalow. You spoke about your family.
You said you had no children, and that you had lost
your wife ten years ago. Your only brother had died
insane, which is why you didn’t want to visit the mental
hospital in Ranchi...”
When Bepin Babu had paid for the books and was
leaving the shop, the man was still looking at him in
utter disbelief.

Bepin Babu’s car was safely parked in Bertram Street
by the Lighthouse Cinema. He told the driver as he got
into the car, “Just drive by the Ganga, will you, Sitaram.”
Driving up the Strand Road, Bepin Babu regretted
having paid so much attention to the intruder. He had
never been to Ranchi — no question about it. It was
inconceivable that he should forget such an incident
which took place only six or seven years ago. He had an
excellent memory. Unless — Bepin Babu’s head reeled.

Was he losing his mind? But how could that be? He
was working daily in his office. It was a big firm, and he
was doing a responsible job. He wasn’t aware of anything
ever going seriously wrong. Only today he spoke for
half an hour at an important meeting. And yet...
And yet the man knew a great deal about him. How?
He even seemed to know some intimate details. The bag
of books, wife’s death, brother’s insanity... The only
mistake was about his having gone to Ranchi. Not a
mistake; a deliberate lie. In ’58, during the Pujas, he
was in Kanpur at his friend Haridas Bagchi’s place.
All Bepin Babu had to do was write to — no, there was
no way of writing to Haridas. Bepin Babu suddenly
remembered that Haridas had left with his wife for Japan
some weeks ago, and he didn’t have his address.
But where was the need for proof? He himself was
fully aware that he hadn’t been to Ranchi — and that
was that.
The river breeze was bracing, and yet a slight
discomfort lingered in Bepin Babu’s mind.
Around Hastings, Bepin Babu decided to roll up his
trousers and take a look at his right knee.
There was the mark of an old inch-long cut. It was
impossible to tell when the injury had occurred.

Had he never had a fall as a boy and cut his knee? He
tried to recall such an incident, but couldn’t.
Then Bepin Babu suddenly thought of Dinesh
Mukerji. The man had said that Dinesh was in Ranchi
at the same time. The best thing surely would be to ask
him. He lived quite near — in Beninandan Street. What
about going right now? But then, if he had really never
been to Ranchi, what would Dinesh think if Bepin Babu
asked for a confirmation? He would probably conclude
Bepin Babu was going nuts. No; it would be ridiculous
to ask him.
And he knew how ruthless Dinesh’s sarcasm
could be.
Sipping a cold drink in his air-conditioned living
room, Bepin Babu felt at ease again. Such a nuisance!
Just because they have nothing else to do, they go about
getting into other people’s hair.
After dinner, snuggling in bed with one of the new
thrillers, Bepin Babu forgot all about the man in New
Market.
Next day, in the office, Bepin Babu noticed that with
every passing hour, the previous day’s encounter was
occupying more and more of his mind. If the man knew
so much about Bepin Babu, how could he make such a
mistake about the Ranchi trip?
Just before lunch Bepin Babu decided to ring up
Dinesh Mukerji. It was better to settle the question over
the phone; at least the embarrassment on his face
wouldn’t show.
Two-Three-Five-Six-One-Six. Bepin Babu dialled
the number.
“Hallo.”
“Is that Dinesh? This is Bepin here.”
“Well, well — what’s the news?”
“I just wanted to find out if you recalled an incident
which took place in ’58.”

“Were you in Calcutta right through that year? That’s
the first thing I’ve got to know.”
“Wait just a minute... ’58... just let me check in
my diary.”
For a minute there was silence. Bepin Babu could
feel that his heartbeat had gone up. He was sweating
a little.
“Hallo.”
“Yes.”
“I've got it. I’d been out twice.”
“Where?”
“Once in February — nearby — to Krishnanagar to a
nephew’s wedding. And then... but you’d know about
this one. The trip to Ranchi. You were there too. That’s
all. But what’s all this sleuthing about?”
“No. I just wanted to — anyway, thanks.”
Bepin Babu slammed the receiver down and gripped
his head with his hands. He felt his head swimming. A
chill seemed to spread over his body. There were
sandwiches in his tiffin box, but he didn’t eat them. He
had lost his appetite.

tireless, conscientious worker. But today his head was
in a whirl.
Back home at two-thirty, Bepin Babu lay down in
bed and tried to gather his wits together. He knew that
it was possible to lose one’s memory through an injury
in the head, but he didn’t know of a single instance of
someone remembering everything except one particular
incident — and a fairly recent and significant one at
that. He had always wanted to go to Ranchi; to have
gone there, done things, and not to remember was
something utterly impossible.
At seven thirty, Bepin Babu’s servant came and
announced, “Chuni Babu, sir. Says it’s very important.”
Bepin Babu knew what Chuni had come for. Chunilal
had been at school with him. He’d been having a rough
time lately and had been coming to see him about a
job. Bepin Babu knew it was not possible to do anything
for him and, in fact, told him so. But Chuni kept turning
up like a bad penny.
Bepin Babu sent word that not only was it not
possible for him to see Chuni now, but not in several
weeks.
But as soon as the servant stepped out of the room,
it struck Bepin Babu that Chuni might remember
something about the ’58 trip. There was no harm in
asking him.
Bepin Babu hurried down the stairs and into the
living room. Chuni was about to leave, but seeing Bepin
Babu appear, he turned round hopefully.
Bepin Babu didn’t beat about the bush.
“Listen, Chuni - I want to ask you something. You
have a good memory, and you've been seeing me off
and on for a long time. Just throw your mind back and
tell me - did I go to Ranchi in ’58?”
Chuni said, “’58? It must have been ’58. Or was it
’59?”

“You’re sure that I did go to Ranchi?”
Chuni’s look of amazement was not unmixed with
worry.
“D’ you mean you have doubts about having gone at
all?”
“Did I go? Do you remember clearly?”
Chuni sat down on the sofa, fixed Bepin Babu with
a long, hard stare and said, “Bepin, have you taken to
drugs or something? As far as I know, you had a clean
record where such things were concerned. I know that
old friendships don’t mean much to you, but at least
you had a good memory. You can’t really mean that
you’ve forgotten about the Ranchi trip?”
Bepin Babu had to turn away from Chuni’s
incredulous stare.
“Do you remember what my last job was?” asked
Chunilal.
“Of course. You worked in a travel agency.”
“You remember that and you don’t remember that it
was I who fixed up your railway booking for Ranchi? I
went to the station to see you off; one of the fans in
your compartment was not working — I got an electrician
to fix it. Have you forgotten everything? Whatever is the
matter with you? You don’t look too well, you know.”
Bepin Babu sighed and shook his head.
“I’ve been working too hard,” he said at last. “That
must be the reason. Must see about consulting a
specialist.”
Doubtless it was Bepin’s condition which made
Chunilal leave without mentioning anything about a job.
Paresh Chanda was a young physician with a pair of
bright eyes and a sharp nose. He became thoughtful
when he heard about Bepin Babu’s symptoms. “Look,
Dr Chanda,” said Bepin Babu desperately, “You must
cure me of this horrible illness. I can’t tell you how it's
affecting my work.”

Dr Chanda shook his head.
“You know what, Mr Choudhury,” he said. “I’ve never
had to deal with a case such as yours. Frankly, this is
quite outside my field of experience. But I have one
suggestion. I don’t know if it’ll work, but it’s worth a
try. It can do no harm.”
Bepin Babu leaned forward anxiously.
“As far as I can make out,” said Dr Chanda, “And I
think you’re of the same opinion — you must have been
to Ranchi, but due to some unknown reason, the entire
episode has slipped out of your mind. What I suggest is
that you go to Ranchi once again. The sight of the place
may remind you of your trip. This is not impossible.
More than that I cannot do at the moment. I’m
prescribing a nerve tonic and a tranquilliser. Sleep is
essential, or the symptoms will get more pronounced.”
Bepin Babu felt somewhat better the next morning.
After breakfast, he rang up his office, gave some
instructions and then procured a first class ticket for
Ranchi for the same evening.

Getting off the train at Ranchi next morning, he realised
at once that he had never been there before.
He came out of the station, took a taxi and drove
around the town for a while. He realised that the streets,
the buildings, the hotels, the bazaars, the Morabadi Hill
— with none of these had he the slightest acquaintance.
Would a trip to the Hudroo Falls help? He didn't believe
so, but, at the same time, he didn't wish to leave with the
feeling that he hadn’t tried enough. So he arranged for a
car and left for Hudroo in the afternoon.

At five o’clock the same afternoon in Hudroo, two
Gujarati gentlemen from a group of picnickers discovered
Bepin Babu lying unconscious beside a boulder. When
he came round, the first thing Bepin Babu said was,
“I’m finished. There’s no hope left.”
Next morning, Bepin Babu was back in Calcutta. He
realised that there was truly no hope for him. Soon he
would lose everything: his will to work, his confidence,
his ability, his balance of mind. Was he going to end up
in the asylum at...? Bepin Babu couldn’t think any more.
Back home, he rang up Dr Chanda and asked him to
come over. Then, after a shower, he got into bed with an
ice bag clamped on his head. Just then the servant brought
him a letter which someone had left in the letter box.

When Dr Chanda came, Bepin Babu said, “I’m fine.
It all came back as soon as I got off the train at Ranchi.”
“A unique case,” said Dr Chanda. “I shall certainly
write about it in a medical journal.”
“The reason why I sent for you,” said Bepin Babu, “is
that I have a pain in the hip from a fall I had in Ranchi.

The fair maid came out and said, “I will hire you with

Her smile paled and melted into tears, and she went
back alone into the dark.
The sun glistened on the sand, and the sea waves broke

A child sat playing with shells.
He raised his head and seemed to know me and said,
“I hire you with nothing.”
From henceforward that bargain struck in child’s play
made me a free man.
