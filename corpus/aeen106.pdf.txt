If I Were an Apple

Learn, recite and enjoy this poem

d
e

If I were an apple
And grew on a tree,
I think I’d drop down
On a nice boy like me.
I wouldn’t stay there
Giving nobody joy,
I’d fall down at once
And say, “Eat me, my boy!”

A little bird sees
Ripe fruit on our tree
And eats a tasty berry.
The bird flies tall
And a berry seed falls.

The rains have come
Hurry! let’s run.
Clouds, rain and sun...
Our plant is born, a little one.

Now a tree,
With branches long,
Crows and bird-song,
Crawling ants and spiders’ webs,
Caterpillars with tiny legs,
Rich green leaves, life aplenty.

The tree has fruit,
Some big, some small,
Let us pluck them
But do not fall!
Crows perch, squirrels run,
And see the monkeys
Having fun!
