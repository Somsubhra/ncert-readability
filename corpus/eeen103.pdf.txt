My Shadow
Do you know whenever there is light someone
follows you? Have you ever wondered who it is?

Read and Enjoy
I have a little shadow that goes
in and out with me.
And what can be the use of him is
more than I can see.
He is very, very like me from the
heels up to the head;
And I see him jump before me,
When I jump into my bed.

42

The funniest thing about him is the way
he likes to grow
Not at all like proper children, which is
always very slow;
For he sometimes shoots up taller like an
India-rubber ball,
And he sometimes gets so little that
There's none of him at all.
One morning, very early, before the
sun I was up,
I rose and found the shining dew
on every buttercup;
But my lazy little shadow, like an
arrant sleepyhead.
Had stayed at home behind me and was
Fast asleep in bed.
ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

New Words

Robinson Crusoe
Discovers a Footprint

48

Robinson Crusoe's ship had been destroyed by the sea.
He had been alone for many years and longed for
company. One day he discovers a footprint on the sand.
Let's find out what he did then.

One day, when I was going towards my boat, I was
surprised to see the footprint of a man on the sand. I
stood amazed! I listened; I looked around me; I could
neither hear nor see anything. I went up higher to look
down; I went up the shore and down the shore, but it was
no good; I could find no other footprint but that one. I
went to it again to see if there were any more footprints
and to tell if it had been my imagination. But I was not
mistaken, for there was exactly the print of a foot — toes,
heel, every part of a foot. I could not imagine
how it came there.
I stayed a long time thinking, but
became more and more confused.

me after every two or three steps, mistaking every bush
and tree to be a man.
When I came to my cave (which I called my castle), I
ran inside it, as if I was being chased. I do not remember
whether I used the ladder or went in by the hole in the

50

rock, which I called the door. I ran for cover, faster than
any animal could run.
I did not sleep that night. The more I thought about
what I had seen, the more afraid I became. I thought it
could be one of the savages of the mainland who had
wandered out to the sea, in a small boat.
Luckily I was not on shore at that time, but what if he
had seen my boat! If he had seen the boat he would have
realised that someone lived on the island and would soon
return with others to kill and eat me.
And so I lay fearful for many days and prayed for
protection. In doing so, I was much comforted and began
going out to investigate. But even now as I went forward, I
looked behind me frequently, because I was still
very frightened.
However, as I went about for two or three days and
saw nothing I became a little bolder. I decided to go down
to the shore again and examine the footprint once more. I
decided to measure it with my own footmark.
As I came closer to the footprint, I realised that it could
not be my footprint because I had not come to this part of
the beach since a long time. Secondly, as I placed my foot
alongside that footprint, it seemed larger than my own.
My fear returned! I went home again, believing that
there was someone there.
The island was inhabited!
(Adapted from Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe)

UNIT 3

Teacher's Page

Poem: My Shadow
Story: Robinson Crusoe Discovers a Footprint

THEMES
Investigating the unknown
Suspense and sense of curiosity
Overcoming fears by scientific analysis
READING TIME
A classroom library reading programme would provide for reading tastes, interests
and abilities of all children. The teacher should ask the children to read the original
story, Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe. They could also read other books on
adventure, stories of family life, humour, mystery, animals stories and stories of
people, and talk about what they have read. The exceptional qualities one finds in
adventurers can be discussed in class.
CONVERSATION TIME
Take the children outdoors to see the shadows of trees and the school building. Help
them understand the absence of shadows on a cloudy day. The teacher should
explain the shortening and lengthening of shadows through the day.
Since this unit is about our fears, the children could be asked to express some of their
fears, also their unreasonable fears. They can discuss how best to deal with these
fears.

WRITING TIME
The two creative writing exercises have leading questions to guide the children.
These exercises will stimulate their imagination.
PROJECT WORK
Find out how ships and planes are guided towards land? The children should
consult the encyclopedia and share their answers with the class. To cultivate a
taste for reading, one period a week can be devoted to using the library. Books
appropriate to the age group can be chosen for individual reading. Children can
be asked to write about the book they have read during the language class or
share a story with their classmates.
