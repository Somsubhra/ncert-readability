A.K. Ramanujan is one of India’s finest Englishlanguage poets. He is best known for his
pioneering translations of ancient Tamil poetry
into modern English. At the time of his death he
was professor of linguistics at the University of
Chicago and was recognised as the world’s
most profound scholar of South Indian
languages and culture.
His interests included anthropology and folklore.
These influenced his work as a craftsman of
English. This poem represents the complex
distillation of a lifetime of unusual thought and
feeling.

sequence each half-hour, out of the accidents

of alloy, a maker’s shaking hand
in Switzerland, or the mutual distances

commemorating a donor’s whim,
the perennial feuds and seasonal alliance
of Hindu, Christian, and Muslim—
cut off sometimes by a change of wind,

a change of mind, or a siren
between the pieces of a backstreet quarrel.
