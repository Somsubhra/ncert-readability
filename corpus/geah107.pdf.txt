Abbu Khan kept goats as pets.
He loved his goats, but they left him one by one.
He bought a young pretty goat and called her Chandni.

ONCE upon a time there lived an old man in Almora. He
was popularly known as Abbu Khan. He lived all alone
except for a few goats which he always kept as pets. He
gave his goats funny names such as Kalua, Moongia or
Gujri. He would take them out for grazing during the day
and talk to them as one talks to one’s own children; at
night he would bring them back to his little hut and put a
string round the neck of each goat.
Poor Abbu Khan was a little unlucky in the matter of his
goats. Very often at night one of the goats would pull and
pull at the string till it broke loose, and then would disappear
in the hills beyond. Goats in hilly regions hate being tied to
trees or poles. They love their freedom. Abbu Khan’s goats
were of the best hill breed. They too loved their freedom. So
whenever they got the chance, they would run away only to
get killed by an old wolf who lived in the hills.
Whenever one of his goats disappeared, Abbu Khan was
very sad. He did not understand why even the juiciest grass
and grains that he gave them, and all the love that he

showered on them, would not stop these unfortunate goats
from running straight into the jaws of death. Are these goats
mad, he wondered! Or was it their love for freedom! But
freedom meant struggle, hardship, even death. Abbu Khan
couldn’t solve the mystery.
One day, when all his goats had left him, Abbu Khan
said to himself, “No more goats in my house ever again. I
may yet live for a few more years but I’ll live without goats.”
However, the poor old man was terribly lonely. He simply
couldn’t do without his pets. Very soon he bought a young
goat. He thought, “A young goat will stay with me much
longer. She will soon begin to love me as well as the food I
give her every day. She will never want to go to the hills.”
And he laughed with joy.
The new goat was very pretty. She was white as snow,
and had two little horns on her little head, and a pair of

gleaming red eyes. She had a friendly temperament, and
would listen to Abbu Khan’s tales with a lot of interest and
affection. Abbu Khan called her Chandni, which means
‘moonlight’. He loved Chandni and would narrate to her
stories of all his friends who were dead and gone.
Several years passed; Chandni was still there. Abbu
Khan believed that Chandni would never leave his
compound for the free and fresh air of the hills beyond.
Alas! he was mistaken again.

1. Why did Abbu Khan’s goats want to run away? What happened to
them in the hills?
2. Abbu Khan said, “No more goats in my house ever again.” Then
he changed his mind. Why?
3. Why did he buy a young goat?

Like other goats, Chandni too missed the hills.
She told Abbu Khan she must have her freedom.
The story of the dangerous wolf in the forest did not
discourage Chandni.
Every morning Chandni watched the hilltops bathed in
the sunlight. “How beautiful those hills are!” she thought.
“How refreshing the breeze that blows through them! And
how lovely to run across those green fields!” She ran
towards the hills but had to stop with a jerk—the rope
round her neck wouldn’t let her go any further. How she
hated that rope!
She stopped eating the green grass Abbu Khan brought
for her; nor did she listen to his stories with interest and
affection. She lost her appetite, grew very thin and stared
moodily at the hilltops bathed in sunlight. Abbu Khan did
not understand Chandni’s anguish. At last, she decided to
speak to him frankly. “Dear Abbu Khan,” she said, “let me
go to the hills, please. If I stay on in your compound, I’ll
die.” Now Abbu Khan understood Chandni’s problem,
but it made him very unhappy. The earthen pot which
contained Chandni’s breakfast fell from his hands and
broke into a thousand pieces.
“Why do you want to leave me, Chandni?” Abbu Khan
asked.
“I want to go to the hills,” Chandni answered.
“Don’t you like the food here? I’ll give you tastier food
and a much longer rope.”
“No, thank you. Let me go to the hills.”
“Do you realise the risk you are running, you obstinate
creature? There is a dangerous wolf in the hills. He’ll eat
you up.” Abbu Khan did his best to warn her.
Chandni answered, “God has given me a pair of horns.
I’ll fight the wolf.”

“Fight the wolf, indeed! Have you forgotten the story of
your sister Kalua who was the size of a big deer. She fought
the wolf through the night but was killed in the morning.”
Abbu Khan narrated Kalua’s story for the fiftieth time.

To all this Chandni had only one thing to say: “I want to
go to the hills.”
Abbu Khan got very annoyed. He thundered, “You are
not going anywhere. From today you’ll live in a small hut,
and not move about freely in the compound. Ungrateful as
you are, you must still be saved from the wolf.” He pushed
her into a small hut and shut the door. But he forgot to
close the small window at the back. The same night
Chandni made that window her passage to freedom.

1. Why did Chandni hate the rope round her neck?
2. “Now Abbu Khan understood Chandni’s problem...” What was
Chandni’s problem?
3. Abbu Khan pushed Chandni into a small hut. This shows that he
(i) was cruel.
(ii) loved her and wanted to save her life.
(iii) was selfish.
Chandni went back to the hills.
She knew the wolf was somewhere there.
She was ready to put up a good fight.

Chandni reached the hills. It seemed to her that the old
hills were standing in a row to welcome her. She felt like a
child meeting her parents after years of separation.
Wherever she went, the tall grass rose to embrace her, the
flowers bloomed to amuse her and the wind sang an endless
song of welcome. How different all this was from her past
in the prison-house of Abbu Khan’s compound! It was the
happiest day in Chandni’s life.
That day she played for hours on the grassy slopes of
the hills. She met a herd of wild goats who asked her to
join their group. But Chandni politely refused. She wanted
to enjoy her new freedom all by herself.
The sun disappeared behind the hills, and soon
darkness enveloped the grass, the flowers and the trees.
The wind stopped blowing, and there was stillness all
around except for a strange sound which was coming from
the bushes. The sound was like a grunt. What was it? It
wasn’t Abbu Khan’s voice calling her back to the compound;
nor was it the voice of another goat. Then Chandni thought
of the dangerous wolf who lived in the hills. She felt scared.

Should she go back to the safety of Abbu Khan’s hut? “No,”
she said to herself, “death in an open field is far better than
life in a small hut”. The wolf had come out of the bushes,
and was staring greedily at Chandni. His eyes were shining
like burning coals in the darkness. He seemed in no hurry.
He knew the new goat was his.
The wolf and the goat sized up each other. The wolf was
big and ferocious whereas the goat, though healthy, was
small. But small is not weak. Chandni stood firm on her
legs, head slightly bent and horns jutting out. She was a
picture of courage. She looked like a brave soldier ready
to fight a treacherous enemy. “I must put up a good
fight,” Chandni thought; “success or failure is a matter of
luck or chance.”
The fight began. It went on through the night. The moon,
which had been watching the fight, began to grow pale and

suddenly hid behind the clouds. The stars also began to
disappear one by one. A faint light appeared in the east
and the morning call for prayer came from a distant mosque.
The first rays of the sun saw Chandni lying on the
ground. She was completely soaked in blood. The wolf,
tired and sleepy, was getting ready to devour her.
An assembly of birds perched on top of a tree nearby
was debating the result of the fight. “Who is the winner?”
one of them asked. “The wolf, of course,” most of them
said. A wise old bird declaimed with confidence, “Chandni
is the winner.”

ZAKIR HUSAIN

(an adaptation)

1. Why did Chandni refuse to join the group of wild goats?
2. Chandni fought the wolf because she
(i) was stronger than the wolf.
(ii) hated the wolf.
(iii) had to retain her freedom at all costs.

Discuss the following topics in groups.
1. Why did the wise old bird say, “Chandni is the winner”?
2. “Death in an open field is better than life in a small hut,” Chandni
said to herself. Was it the right decision? Give reasons for
your answer.
3. Freedom is life. Discuss this with reference to ‘Chandni’ and
‘I Want Something in a Cage’.
