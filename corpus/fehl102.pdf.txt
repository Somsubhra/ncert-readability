You may know that the dog and the wolf are
closely related. You may also know something
about how over the centuries, human beings have
domesticated and tamed wild animals. Here is a
story about how the dog became a tame animal.

1. DOGS were once their own masters and
lived the way wolves do, in freedom,
until a dog was born who was ill pleased
with this way of life. He was sick and
tired of wandering about by himself

saying) not happy

looking for food and being frightened
of those who were stronger than he.
He thought it over and decided that
the best thing for him to do was to
become the servant of one who was
stronger than anyone on earth, and he
set out to find such a master.
He walked and he walked and he met
a kinsman of his, a big wolf who was
as strong as he was fierce.
“Where are you going, Dog?” the Wolf
asked.
“I am looking for someone to take
up service with. Would you like to be
my master, Wolf?”
“I don’t see why not!” the Wolf said,
and this agreed upon, the two of them
went on together.
They walked and they walked, and all
of a sudden the Wolf lifted his nose,
sniffed, darted quickly off the path and
into the bushes and crept deeper into
the forest. The Dog was much surprised.
“What’s come over you, master?” he
asked. “What has frightened you so?”
“Can’t you see? There’s a Bear out
there, and he might eat up both of
us — you and me.”
Seeing that the Bear was stronger
than the Wolf, the Dog decided to take
up service with him, and he left the
Wolf and asked the Bear to be his
master. The Bear agreed to this readily

and said, “Let us go and find a herd of
cows. I’ll kill a cow and then we can
both eat our fill.”
6.
They walked on and soon saw a herd
of cows, but just as they were about to
come up to it they were stopped by a
terrible noise. The cows were mooing
loudly and running in a panic in
all directions.
7.
The Bear looked out from behind a
tree, and then he too ran hastily deeper
into the forest.

“Now, why did I have to come here!”
said he to the Dog. “It is the Lion who
rules the forest in these parts.”
“The Lion? Who’s he?”
“Don’t you know? He is the strongest
beast on earth!”
“Well, then, I’ll say goodbye to you,
Bear. I want a master who is stronger
than anyone on earth!”
8.
And off the Dog went to ask the Lion
to be his master.
The Lion agreed to it, and the Dog
stayed with him and served him for a
long, long time. It was a good life, and
he had nothing to complain of, for there
was no stronger beast in the forest than
the Lion, and no one dared touch the
Dog or offend him in any way.
9.
But one day the two of them were
walking side by side along a path that
ran amid bare cliffs when all of a sudden
the Lion stopped. He gave a great roar
and struck the ground angrily with his
paw with such force that a hole formed
there. Then he began to back away very
quietly.
“What is it, Master, is anything
wrong?” asked the Dog, surprised.
“I smell a man coming this way,” the
Lion said. “We’d better run for it or we’ll
be in trouble.”
“Oh, well, then I’ll say goodbye to you,
Lion. I want a master who is stronger
than anyone on earth!”

And off the Dog went to join the
man and he stayed with him and
served him faithfully. This happened
long, long ago, but to this day the dog
is man’s most loyal servant and knows
no other master.

D. Read the following passage and do the exercises that follow.
Then complete the family tree of dogs given on the facing page.

The Dog Family
The dog family is one of the 11 families that make up the Carnivores,
a large group of intelligent, flesh-eating, backboned animals. In this
group are such varied animals as bears, pandas, raccoons, cats,
hyenas, and even seal. The dog or canine family has many wild
species like wolves, foxes, coyotes, jackals, and wild dogs.
The dog is the only domesticated member of the canine family
though now and then someone tames a wolf, fox or coyote as a pet.
All members of the dog family are descendants of a wolf-like animal
which lived about 15 million years ago. From this distant ancestor,
the true dogs gradually developed. But nobody knows the exact
ancestor of the modern domestic dog.
Several wild dogs look and behave like domestic dogs. The dingo
or wild dog of Australia is one of these. It is possible that the dingo
was a tamed dog brought to Australia long ago which then ran wild.
Dogs were the first animals tamed by humans — perhaps 20,000
years ago. Tamed dogs were brought from Asia to the New World
5,000 or more years ago. Dogs were first used for hunting.

Here are some points from a similar story that you might have
heard in another language. Dividing the class into two groups try
and tell the story in English. One person from each group can
speak alternately. Your teacher will help you. As you tell it, one of
you may write it down on the board.

The Last Ride Together

There was a young man of Niger
Who went for a ride on a tiger.
They returned from their ride,
With the man inside,
And a smile on the face of the tiger.

The Kite
All of us like to fly kites. Have you ever tried to fly one? Read
this poem about a kite as it flies in the sky.

How bright on the blue
Is a kite when it’s new!
With a dive and a dip
It snaps its tail
Then soars like a ship
With only a sail
As over tides
Of wind it rides,
Climbs to the crest
Of a gust and pulls,
Then seems to rest
As wind falls.
When string goes slack
You wind it back
And run until
A new breeze blows
And its wings fill
And up it goes!
How bright on the blue
Is a kite when it’s new!
But a raggeder thing
You never will see
When it flaps on a string
In the top of a tree.
