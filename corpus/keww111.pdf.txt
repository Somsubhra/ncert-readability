The word ‘poetry’ originates from a Greek word meaning
‘to make’. A poet is thus a maker and the poem
something that is made or created. No single definition
of poetry is possible but some characteristic features
of poetry may be mentioned. Poetry has a musical
quality with rhythm, pitch, metre; and it may use
figures of speech such as simile and metaphor.
While quite a few poems in this selection are in
traditional forms, the unit also includes modern poems
that are free from formal restrictions.
Examples of ‘haiku’ and ‘limerick’ have been included
to introduce learners to these forms and to make
students look to poetry for fun. Students need not be
set questions or tested on this.

The Peacock

The Peacock
Sujata Bhatt

His loud sharp call
seems to come from nowhere.
Then, a flash of turquoise
in the pipal tree
The slender neck arched away from you
as he descends,
and as he darts away, a glimpse
of the very end of his tail.

I was told
that you have to sit in the veranda
And read a book,
preferably one of your favourites
with great concentration..
The moment you begin to live
inside the book
A blue shadow will fall over you.
The wind will change direction,
The steady hum of bees
In the bushes nearby
will stop.
The cat will awaken and stretch.
Something has broken your attention;
And if you look up in time
You might see the peacock turning away as he gathers
his tail
To shut those dark glowing eyes,
Violet fringed with golden amber.
It is the tail that has to blink
For eyes that are always open.
