There was a mother tiger and her small tiger cub. They lived near
a river in a shady jungle. When the sky was dark, the mother tiger
hunted for deer and pig. The
tiger cub stayed close by his
mother's side.

When the Langur monkey
saw her, he called a loud, harsh
call: "Watch out! A tiger is
coming!" The sambhar deer
bellowed, the kakar deer
barked, and sometimes the
game got away. She hunted
then for jungle fowl, for
pheasant and for frog, or went to the river for fish. But she did not
hunt every night.
If the moon was bright, the mother tiger lay down and
waited for the dawn. She twitched the tip of her tail, and the tiger
cub pounced on her tail again and again.

the mother tiger called him
with a low, quiet grunt. The
tiger cub came back, but he

mother in the jungle at night.

One night the mother
tiger was tired and closed her
eyes. The tiger cub saw a tiny
frog, hopping along the
ground. The tiger cub
pounced, but the frog hopped
away. He chased the frog and
caught it, and turned to show his mother. But she was not in
sight. Instead he saw a tiger, bigger than his mother, near him in
the jungle.
The tiger's green eyes glistened as he watched the tiger cub.
The tiger cub was frightened. He could not hide or run. He let the
frog hop away. The tiger crept up closer to the little tiger cub.

But a roar
filled the jungle,
the roar of the
mother tiger!
She faced the
other tiger and
he went away.
The mother
tiger liked to
roar, a loud, big
tiger roar, to tell
all the other animals in the jungle that she was there. All the
other animals in the jungle kept far, far away.

But, there came a year when the small tiger cub was a fullgrown tiger. He walked for miles alone, hunting for game at night.
When he roared to tell all the other animals in the jungle that he
was there, all the other animals in the jungle kept far, far away.
And the great big tiger that had been a small tiger cub, hearing
his own loud roar, smiled to himself a great big tiger smile.

emotional bonding between animals and their young ones.

Discuss animals of the jungle and what they eat, where they live etc. Also talk
l
about different animal homes.

While teaching this Unit you must emphasise the importance of showing care
l
and respect to all animals big or small, domestic or wild. Children should
understand how important it is to protect all animals.
You can
l

discuss with them the decreasing number of tigers and other wild
animals because of hunting and killing. Talk of a world where there may be no
animals in the future.

Ask children
l

to draw and paint different animal masks out of thick paper for
the role-play activity.

Encourage
l

the children to watch animal-based programmes on
television. Let them talk about these in the class.

Ask the
l

children to draw their favourite animals or a scene from
one of their favourite stories about animals.

Encourage the children to tell stories about animals as they have
l

no
tt

heard from their elders.
