BEFORE YOU READ
Gavin Maxwell lives in a cottage in Camusfearna, in the West
Highlands in Scotland. When his dog Jonnie died, Maxwell was too
sad to think of keeping a dog again. But life without a pet was
lonely... Read what happened then, in Maxwell’s own words.
Activity
1. Do you have a pet? If you do, you perhaps know that a pet is a
serious responsibility. Read in the box below what the SPCA —
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals — has to
say about how to care for a pet.
Owning a pet is a lifetime of commitment (up to ten years or
more if you own a dog or a cat) involving considerable
responsibility. The decision to acquire one, therefore, should
be made by the whole family. Without full agreement by
everyone, the pet could end up unwanted. Puppies and
kittens are so adorable, it is easy to understand why adults
and children alike would be attracted to them. Unfortunately
their cute looks are often a disadvantage, because people
purchase them without consideration and the knowledge on
how to take proper care of them. The basic points you should
keep in mind before adopting a puppy are:
• an annual dog licence in accordance with government
regulations
• its annual vaccination against major diseases
• toilet training
• regular grooming and bathing
• obedience training
• don’t forget you should feed your pet a balanced diet
• socialisation (many dogs are kept confined in cages or tied
up to stop them from dirtying the garden or from chewing
on shoes — this is wrong) is very important
• a daily dose of exercise, affection and play.

Reading up on the subject beforehand is another
important requirement and will guide you towards being a
responsible pet owner. Selected pet shops and major book
stores provide books on the care of various breeds/pets.
2. Imagine someone has gifted you a pet. With your partner’s help,
make a list of the things you need to know about the pet in
order to take good care of it. One has been done for you.
(i) The food it eats.
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
3. Otters are found in large numbers in the marshes (i.e. wet
areas near lakes, rivers or seas) near Basra, a town in Iraq.
Imagine you wanted to bring an otter from Iraq to London,
as a pet. What special arrangements would you need to
make for your pet otter? You would need to find a place
with lots of water, for example. What other points should
you think about? The information about Iraq and London
given below may help you.
London

Iraq has mostly broad plains
and marshes along the
Iranian border in the south,
with large flooded areas. A
large part of Iraq’s land area
is desert, so it has cool
winters and dry, hot and
cloudless summers. The
mountain areas near Iran
and Turkey have cold winters.
There is heavy snowfall there,
and when the snow melts in
spring, it causes floods in
central and southern Iraq.

London
has
a
large
population and is a very busy
city. In addition to multistoreyed buildings, however,
it has many open spaces or
parks. It has a temperate
climate (i.e. it is neither very
hot, nor very cold), with
regular but generally light
rainfall or snow throughout
the year. The warmest month
is July, and the coolest
month is January. February
is the driest month. Snow is
not very common in London.

EARLY in the New Year of 1956 I travelled to Southern
Iraq. By then it had crossed my mind that I should
like to keep an otter instead of a dog, and that
Camusfearna, ringed by water a stone’s throw from
its door, would be an eminently suitable spot for
this experiment.
When I casually mentioned this to a friend, he
as casually replied that I had better get one in the
Tigris marshes, for there they were as common as
mosquitoes, and were often tamed by the Arabs.
We were going to Basra to the Consulate-General
to collect and answer our mail from Europe. At the
Consulate-General we found that my friend’s mail
had arrived but that mine had not.
I cabled to England, and when, three days later,
nothing had happened, I tried to telephone. The call
had to be booked twenty-four hours in advance. On
the first day the line was out of order; on the second
the exchange was closed for a religious holiday. On
the third day there was another breakdown. My
friend left, and I arranged to meet him in a week’s
time. Five days later, my mail arrived.
I carried it to my bedroom to read, and there,
squatting on the floor, were two Arabs; beside them
lay a sack that squirmed from time to time. They
handed me a note from my friend: “Here is your otter...”

With the opening of that sack began a phase of my
life that has not yet ended, and may, for all I know,
not end before I do. It is, in effect, a thraldom to
otters, an otter fixation, that I have since found to
be shared by most other people, who have ever
owned one.
The creature that emerged from this sack on to
the spacious tiled floor of the Consulate bedroom
resembled most of all a very small, medievallyconceived, dragon. From the head to the tip of the

tail he was coated with symmetrical pointed scales
of mud armour, between whose tips was visible a
soft velvet fur like that of a chocolate-brown mole.
He shook himself, and I half expected a cloud of
dust, but in fact it was not for another month that I
managed to remove the last of the mud and see the
otter, as it were, in his true colours.
Mijbil, as I called the otter, was, in fact, of a
race previously unknown to science, and was at
length christened by zoologists Lutrogale perspicillata
maxwelli, or Maxwell’s otter. For the first twentyfour hours Mijbil was neither hostile nor friendly;
he was simply aloof and indifferent, choosing to
sleep on the floor as far from my bed as possible.
The second night Mijbil came on to my bed in the
small hours and remained asleep in the crook of
my knees until the servant brought tea in the
morning, and during the day he began to lose his
apathy and take a keen, much too keen, interest in
his surroundings. I made a body-belt for him and
took him on a lead to the bathroom, where for half
an hour he went wild with joy in the water, plunging
and rolling in it, shooting up and down the length
of the bathtub underwater, and making enough slosh
and splash for a hippo. This, I was to learn, is a
characteristic of otters; every drop of water must
be, so to speak, extended and spread about the
place; a bowl must at once be overturned, or, if it
will not be overturned, be sat in and sploshed in
until it overflows. Water must be kept on the move
and made to do things; when static it is wasted
and provoking.

First Flight
106

Two days later, Mijbil escaped from my bedroom
as I entered it, and I turned to see his tail
disappearing round the bend of the corridor that
led to the bathroom. By the time I got there he was
up on the end of the bathtub and fumbling at the
chromium taps with his paws. I watched, amazed;
in less than a minute he had turned the tap far
enough to produce a trickle of water, and after a
moment or two achieved the full flow. (He had been
lucky to turn the tap the right way; on later
occasions he would sometimes screw it up still
tighter, chittering with irritation and disappointment
at the tap’s failure to cooperate.)
Very soon Mij would follow me without a lead
and come to me when I called his name. He spent
most of his time in play. He spent hours shuffling a
rubber ball round the room like a four-footed soccer
player using all four feet to dribble the ball, and he
could also throw it, with a powerful flick of the
neck, to a surprising height and distance. But the
real play of an otter is when he lies on his back
and juggles with small objects between his paws.
Marbles were Mij’s favourite toys for this pastime:
he would lie on his back rolling two or more of them
up and down his wide, flat belly without ever
dropping one to the floor.

The days passed peacefully at Basra, but I dreaded
the prospect of transporting Mij to England, and to
Camusfearna. The British airline to London would
not fly animals, so I booked a flight to Paris on
another airline, and from there to London. The
airline insisted that Mij should be packed into a
box not more than eighteen inches square, to be
carried on the floor at my feet. I had a box made,
and an hour before we started, I put Mij into the
box so that he would become accustomed to it, and
left for a hurried meal.
When I returned, there was an appalling
spectacle. There was complete silence from the box,
but from its airholes and chinks around the lid,
blood had trickled and dried. I whipped off the lock
and tore open the lid, and Mij, exhausted and bloodspattered, whimpered and caught at my leg. He had
torn the lining of the box to shreds; when I removed
the last of it so that there were no cutting edges
left, it was just ten minutes until the time of the
flight, and the airport was five miles distant. I put
the miserable Mij back into the box, holding down
the lid with my hand.
I sat in the back of the car with the box beside
me as the driver tore through the streets of Basra
like a ricochetting bullet. The aircraft was waiting
to take off; I was rushed through to it by infuriated
officials. Luckily, the seat booked for me was at
the extreme front. I covered the floor around my
feet with newspapers, rang for the air hostess,
and gave her a parcel of fish (for Mij) to keep in a
cool place. I took her into my confidence about the
events of the last half hour. I have retained the
most profound admiration for that air hostess; she
was the very queen of her kind. She suggested
that I might prefer to have my pet on my knee, and
I could have kissed her hand in the depth of my
gratitude. But, not knowing otters, I was quite
unprepared for what followed.

First Flight
108

Mij was out of the box in a flash. He disappeared
at high speed down the aircraft. There were squawks
and shrieks, and a woman stood up on her seat
screaming out, “A rat! A rat!” I caught sight of Mij’s
tail disappearing beneath the legs of a portly whiteturbaned Indian. Diving for it, I missed, but found
my face covered in curry. “Perhaps,” said the air
hostess with the most charming smile, “it would be
better if you resumed your seat, and I will find the
animal and bring it to you.”
I returned to my seat. I was craning my neck
trying to follow the hunt when suddenly I heard
from my feet a distressed chitter of recognition and
welcome, and Mij bounded on to my knee and began
to nuzzle my face and my neck.

Mij and I remained in London for nearly a month.
He would play for hours with a selection of toys,
ping-pong balls, marbles, rubber fruit, and a
terrapin shell that I had brought back from his native
marshes. With the ping-pong ball he invented a
game of his own which could keep him engrossed
for up to half an hour at a time. A suitcase that I
had taken to Iraq had become damaged on the
journey home, so that the lid, when closed,
remained at a slope from one end to the other. Mij
discovered that if he placed the ball on the high
end it would run down the length of the suitcase.
He would dash around to the other end to ambush
its arrival, hide from it, crouching, to spring up
and take it by surprise, grab it and trot off with it
to the high end once more.
Outside the house I exercised him on a lead,
precisely as if he had been a dog. Mij quickly developed
certain compulsive habits on these walks in the
London streets, like the rituals of children who on
their way to and from school must place their feet
squarely on the centre of each paving block; must
touch every seventh upright of the iron railings, or
pass to the outside of every second lamp post. Opposite
to my flat was a single-storied primary school, along
whose frontage ran a low wall some two feet high. On
his way home, but never on his way out, Mij would
tug me to this wall, jump on to it, and gallop the full
length of its thirty yards, to the hopeless distraction
both of pupils and of staff within.

It is not, I suppose, in any way strange that the
average Londoner should not recognise an otter, but
the variety of guesses as to what kind of animal this
might be came as a surprise to me. Otters belong to
a comparatively small group of animals called
Mustellines, shared by the badger, mongoose, weasel,
stoat, mink and others. I faced a continuous barrage
of conjectural questions that sprayed all the
Mustellines but the otter; more random guesses hit
on ‘a baby seal’ and ‘a squirrel.’ ‘Is that a walrus,
mister?’ reduced me to giggles, and outside a dog
show I heard ‘a hippo’. A beaver, a bear cub, a leopard
— one, apparently, that had changed its spots —
and a ‘brontosaur’; Mij was anything but an otter.
But the question for which I awarded the highest
score came from a labourer digging a hole in the street.
I was still far from him when he laid down his tool,
put his hands on his hips, and began to stare. As I
drew nearer I saw his expression of surprise and
affront, as though he would have me know that he
was not one upon whom to play jokes. I came abreast
of him; he spat, glared, and then growled out, “Here,
Mister — what is that supposed to be?”

5. Read the story and find the sentences where Maxwell describes his pet
otter. Then choose and arrange your sentences to illustrate those statements
below that you think are true.
Maxwell’s description
(i) makes Mij seem almost human, like a small boy.
(ii) shows that he is often irritated with what Mij does.
(iii) shows that he is often surprised by what Mij does.
(iv) of Mij’s antics is comical.

111

(v) shows that he observes the antics of Mij very carefully.
(vi) shows that he thinks Mij is a very ordinary otter.
(vii) shows that he thinks the otter is very unusual.

To talk about something that happened regularly in the past, but does not
happen any longer, we use would or used to. Both would and used to can
describe repeated actions in the past.
(a) Mij would follow me without a lead and come to me when I called his
name.
(b) He would play for hours with a selection of toys.
(c) On his way home… Mij would tug me to this wall.
(d) When I was five years old, I used to follow my brother all over the
place.
(e) He used to tease me when Mother was not around.
To describe repeated states or situations in the past, however, we use only
used to. (We cannot use would for states or situations in the past.) So we do

not use would with verbs like be, have, believe, etc. Look at the following
sentences.
(a) When we were young, we used to believe there were ghosts in school.
(Note: believe shows a state of mind.)
(b) Thirty years ago, more women used to be housewives than now.
(Note: be here describes a situation.)
From the table below, make as many correct sentences as you can using
would and/or used to, as appropriate. (Hint: First decide whether the
words in italics show an action, or a state or situation, in the past.)
Then add two or three sentences of your own to it.

You have seen how Maxwell describes Mij the otter’s feelings and thoughts by
watching him. Play the game of dumb charades. Take turns to express a feeling
or thought silently, through gestures. Let the class speak out their guesses
about the feelings or thoughts you are trying to express.

Write a description of a person or an animal (such as a pet) that you know very
well and love very much. Questions (4) and (5) in ‘Thinking about the Text’ will
have given you some idea about how to do this. Mention some things the person
or animal does, what you think the person or animal feels, etc.

3.

The events narrated in this text took place over half-a-century ago. Discuss with
your class what changes have taken place over these years in
(i) what animals we can keep as pets (some species are protected under the laws
for wildlife preservation)
(ii) the laws for exporting and importing or trading in animals
(iii) rules for transporting goods, pets, etc. on aircraft.
The class might wish to do their own research on these questions and report their
findings in class.
Ask students if they know of other examples of unusual pets or of wild animals which
are trained to work for or amuse humans (eg dancing bears, lions and tigers in a
circus, elephants trained to work or take part in ceremonies). Then lead students into
a discussion about the ethics of keeping wild animals as pets: What are the difficulties
these may entail? According to the students, what will the animal miss most when it
is taken away from its natural habitat? Do they think that it is ‘cute’ to see Mij the
otter on a leash? Get them to look at the situation from all points of view.
