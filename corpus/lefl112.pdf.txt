Before you read

Have you ever visited or seen an elementary school in a slum?
What does it look like?

Far far from gusty waves these children’s faces.
Like rootless weeds, the hair torn round their pallor:
The tall girl with her weighed-down head. The paperseeming boy, with rat’s eyes. The stunted, unlucky heir
Of twisted bones, reciting a father’s gnarled disease,
His lesson, from his desk. At back of the dim class
One unnoted, sweet and young. His eyes live in a dream,
Of squirrel’s game, in tree room, other than this.

On sour cream walls, donations. Shakespeare’s head,
Cloudless at dawn, civilized dome riding all cities.
Belled, flowery, Tyrolese valley. Open-handed map
Awarding the world its world. And yet, for these
Children, these windows, not this map, their world,
Where all their future’s painted with a fog,

A narrow street sealed in with a lead sky
Far far from rivers, capes, and stars of words.
Surely, Shakespeare is wicked, the map a bad example,
With ships and sun and love tempting them to steal—
For lives that slyly turn in their cramped holes
From fog to endless night? On their slag heap, these children
Wear skins peeped through by bones and spectacles of steel
With mended glass, like bottle bits on stones.
All of their time and space are foggy slum.
So blot their maps with slums as big as doom.

Tyrolese valley : pertaining to the Tyrol, an Austrian Alpine province
catacombs
: a long underground gallery with excavations in its sides for
tombs. The name catacombs, before the seventeenth
century was applied to the subterranean cemeteries, near
Rome

Unless, governor, inspector, visitor,
This map becomes their window and these windows
That shut upon their lives like catacombs,
Break O break open till they break the town
And show the children to green fields, and make their world
Run azure on gold sands, and let their tongues
Run naked into books the white and green leaves open
History theirs whose language is the sun.

What do you think is the colour of ‘sour cream’? Why do you
think the poet has used this expression to describe the
classroom walls?

3.

The walls of the classroom are decorated with the pictures of
‘Shakespeare’, ‘buildings with domes’, ‘world maps’ and
beautiful valleys. How do these contrast with the world of these
children?

4.

What does the poet want for the children of the slums? How
can their lives be made to change ?

n

Notice how the poet picturises the condition of the
slum children.
Notice the contrasting images in the poem — for example,
A narrow street sealed in with a lead sky
Far far from rivers, capes, and stars of words.
