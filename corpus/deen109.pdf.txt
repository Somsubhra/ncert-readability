Form groups of five or six children in the class. Sit in circles.
The first child will begin the book chain by saying the name
of a story book. The next child extends the chain by saying
the name of another book. In this way a book chain is
formed. The more the rounds the children can go on for, the
longer the book chain will be. See which group makes the
longest book chain.

Do you know?
The earliest books were written by hand. Two thousand years
ago in India, birch bark (bhojapatra) and palm leaves (talapatra)
were used for pages. A pen and black ink were used to write on
birch bark. A sharp, iron spike was used for writing on palm
leaves. Holes were drilled through the leaves and the book
was held together by a string!
