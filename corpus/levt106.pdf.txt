Before you read

This is a play featuring an old man and a small boy meeting
in the former’s garden. The old man strikes up a friendship
with the boy who is very withdrawn and defiant. What is
the bond that unites the two?

SCENE ONE

Mr Lamb’s garden [There is the occasional sound of birdsong
and of tree leaves rustling. Derry’s footsteps are heard as he
walks slowly and tentatively through the long grass. He
pauses, then walks on again. He comes round a screen of
bushes, so that when Mr Lamb speaks to him he is close at
hand and Derry is startled]

o
n

Who is Mr Lamb?
How does Derry
get into his
garden?

MR LAMB: Mind the apples!
What? Who’s that? Who’s
DERRY:
there?
MR LAMB: Lamb’s my name. Mind the
apples. Crab apples those are.
Windfalls in the long grass.
You could trip.
I....there....I thought this was
DERRY:
an empty place. I didn’t know
there was anybody here....

MR LAMB: That’s all right. I’m here. What are you afraid of,
boy? That’s all right.
I thought it was empty....an empty house.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: So it is. Since I’m out here in the garden. It is
empty. Until I go back inside. In the meantime,
I’m out here and likely to stop. A day like this.
Beautiful day. Not a day to be indoors.
[Panic] I’ve got to go.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: Not on my account. I don’t mind who comes into
the garden. The gate’s always open. Only you
climbed the garden wall.
[Angry] You were watching me.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: I saw you. But the gate’s open. All welcome. You’re
welcome. I sit here. I like sitting.
I’d not come to steal anything.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: No, no. The young lads steal....scrump the apples.
You’re not so young.
I just....wanted to come in. Into the garden.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: So you did. Here we are, then.
You don’t know who I am.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: A boy. Thirteen or so.
Fourteen. [Pause] But I’ve got to go now.
DERRY:
Good-bye.
MR LAMB: Nothing to be afraid of. Just a garden. Just me.
But I’m not....I’m not afraid. [Pause] People are
DERRY:
afraid of me.
MR LAMB: Why should that be?
Everyone is. It doesn’t matter who they are, or
DERRY:
what they say, or how they look. How they
pretend. I know. I can see.
MR LAMB: See what?
What they think.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: What do they think, then?
You think.... ‘Here’s a boy.’ You look at me...and
DERRY:
then you see my face and you think. ‘That’s bad.
That’s a terrible thing. That’s the ugliest thing I
ever saw.’ You think, ‘Poor boy.’ But I’m not. Not
poor. Underneath, you are afraid. Anybody would
be. I am. When I look in the mirror, and see it,
I’m afraid of me.

MR LAMB: No, Not the whole of you. Not of you.
Yes!
DERRY:
[Pause]
MR LAMB: Later on, when it’s a bit cooler, I’ll get the ladder
and a stick, and pull down those crab apples.
They’re ripe for it. I make jelly. It’s a good time of
year, September. Look at them....orange and
golden. That’s magic fruit. I often say. But it’s
best picked and made into jelly. You could give
me a hand.
What have you changed the subject for? People
DERRY:
always do that. Why don’t you ask me? Why do
you do what they all do and pretend it isn’t true
and isn’t there? In case I see you looking and
mind and get upset? I’ll tell....you don’t ask me
because you’re afraid to.
MR LAMB: You want me to ask....say so, then.
I don’t like being with people. Any people.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: I should say....to look at it.... I should say, you
got burned in a fire.
Not in a fire. I got acid all down that side of my
DERRY:
face and it burned it all away. It ate my face up.
It ate me up. And now it’s like this and it won’t
ever be any different.

Aren’t you interested?
DERRY:
MR LAMB: You’re a boy who came into the garden. Plenty
do. I’m interested in anybody. Anything. There’s
nothing God made that doesn’t interest me. Look
over there....over beside the far wall. What can
you see?
Rubbish.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: Rubbish ? Look, boy, look....what do you see?
Just....grass and stuff. Weeds.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: Some call them weeds. If you like, then....a weed
garden, that. There’s fruit and there are flowers,
and trees and herbs. All sorts. But over
there....weeds. I grow weeds there. Why is one
green, growing plant called a weed and another
‘flower’? Where’s the difference. It’s all life....
growing. Same as you and me.
We’re not the same.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: I’m old. You’re young. You’ve got a burned face,
I’ve got a tin leg. Not important. You’re standing
there.... I’m sitting here. Where’s the difference?
Why have you got a tin leg?
DERRY:
MR LAMB: Real one got blown off, years back. Lamey-Lamb,
some kids say. Haven’t you heard them? You will.
Lamey-Lamb. It fits. Doesn’t trouble me.
But you can put on trousers and cover it up and
DERRY:
no one sees, they don’t have to notice and stare.
MR LAMB: Some do. Some don’t. They get tired of it, in the
end. There’s plenty of other things to stare at.
Like my face.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: Like crab apples or the weeds or a spider climbing
up a silken ladder, or my tall sun-flowers.
Things.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: It’s all relative. Beauty and the beast.
What’s that supposed to mean?
DERRY:
MR LAMB: You tell me.
You needn’t think they haven’t all told me that

fairy story before. ‘It’s not what you look like, it’s
what you are inside. Handsome is as handsome

does. Beauty loved the monstrous beast for himself
and when she kissed him he changed into a
handsome prince.’ Only he wouldn’t, he’d have
stayed a monstrous beast. I won’t change.
In that way? No, you won’t.
And no one’ll kiss me, ever. Only my mother, and
she kisses me on the other side of my face, and I
don’t like my mother to kiss me, she does it
because she has to. Why should I like that? I
don’t care if nobody ever kisses me.
Ah, but do you care if you never kiss them.
What?
Girls. Pretty girls. Long hair and large eyes. People
you love.
Who’d let me? Not one.
Who can tell?
I won’t ever look different. When I’m as old as
you, I’ll look the same. I’ll still only have half a
face.
So you will. But the world won’t. The world’s got a
whole face, and the world’s there to be looked at.
Do you think this is the world? This old garden?
When I’m here. Not the only one. But the world,
as much as anywhere.
Does your leg hurt you?
Tin doesn’t hurt, boy!
When it came off, did it?
Certainly.
And now? I mean, where the tin stops, at the top?
Now and then. In wet weather. It doesn’t signify.
Oh, that’s something else they all say. ‘Look at
all those people who are in pain and brave and
never cry and never complain and don’t feel sorry
for themselves.’
I haven’t said it.
And think of all those people worse off than you.
Think, you might have been blinded, or born deaf,
or have to live in a wheelchair, or be daft in your
head and dribble.

It won’t make my face change. Do you know, one
DERRY:
day, a woman went by me in the street — I was
at a bus-stop — and she was with another
woman, and she looked at me, and she said....
whispered....only I heard her.... she said, “Look
at that, that’s a terrible thing. That’s a face only
a mother could love.”
MR LAMB: So you believe everything you hear, then?
It was cruel.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: Maybe not meant as such. Just something said
between them.
Only I heard it. I heard.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: And is that the only thing you ever heard anyone
say, in your life?
Oh no! I’ve heard a lot of things.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: So now you keep your ears shut.
You’re....peculiar. You say peculiar things. You

MR LAMB: I like to talk. Have company. You don’t have to
answer questions. You don’t have to stop here at
all. The gate’s open.
Yes, but...
DERRY:
MR LAMB: I’ve a hive of bees behind those trees over there.
Some hear bees and they say, bees buzz. But
when you listen to bees for a long while, they
humm....and hum means ‘sing’. I hear them
singing, my bees.
But....I like it here. I came in because I liked

it....when I looked over the wall.
MR LAMB: If you’d seen me, you’d not have come in.
No.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: No.
It’d have been trespassing.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: Ah. That’s not why.
I don’t like being near people. When they
DERRY:
stare....when I see them being afraid of me.
MR LAMB: You could lock yourself up in a room and never
leave it. There was a man who did that. He was

afraid, you see. Of everything. Everything in this
world. A bus might run him over, or a man might
breathe deadly germs onto him, or a donkey might
kick him to death, or lightning might strike him
down, or he might love a girl and the girl would
leave him, and he might slip on a banana skin and
fall and people who saw him would laugh their
heads off. So he went into this room, and locked
the door, and got into his bed, and stayed there.
For ever?
For a while.
Then what?
A picture fell off the wall on to his head and
killed him.

You see?
But....you still say peculiar

Peculiar to some.

Books and other things. Full.
Mr Lamb?
But there aren’t any curtains
at the windows.
I’m not fond of curtains. Shutting things out,
shutting things in. I like the light and the
darkness, and the windows open, to hear
the wind.
Yes. I like that. When it’s raining, I like to hear it
on the roof.
So you’re not lost, are you? Not altogether? You
do hear things. You listen.
They talk about me. Downstairs, When I’m not
there. ‘What’ll he ever do? What’s going to happen
to him when we’ve gone? How ever will he get on
in this world? Looking like that? With that on
his face?’ That’s what they say.

MR LAMB: Lord, boy, you’ve got two arms, two legs and eyes
and ears, you’ve got a tongue and a brain. You’ll
get on the way you want, like all the rest. And if
you chose, and set your mind to it, you could get
on better than all the rest.
How?
DERRY:
MR LAMB: Same way as I do.
Do you have any friends?
DERRY:
MR LAMB: Hundreds.
But you live by yourself in that house. It’s a big
DERRY:
house, too.
MR LAMB: Friends everywhere. People come in.... everybody
knows me. The gate’s always open. They come
and sit here. And in front of the fire in winter.
Kids come for the apples and pears. And for toffee.
I make toffee with honey. Anybody comes. So have
you.
But I’m not a friend.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: Certainly you are. So far as I’m concerned. What
have you done to make me think you’re not?
You don’t know me. You don’t know where I come
DERRY:
from or even what my name is.
MR LAMB: Why should that signify? Do I have to write all
your particulars down and put them in a filing
box, before you can be a friend?
I suppose...not. No.
DERRY:
MR LAMB: You could tell me your name. If you chose. And
not, if you didn’t.
Derry. Only it’s Derek....but I hate that. Derry. If
DERRY:
I’m your friend, you don’t have to be mine. I choose
that.
MR LAMB: Certainly.
I might never come here again, you might never
DERRY:
see me again and then I couldn’t still be a friend.
MR LAMB: Why not?
How could I? You pass people in the street and
DERRY:
you might even speak to them, but you never see
them again. It doesn’t mean they’re friends.

Doesn’t mean they’re enemies, either, does it?
No they’re just....nothing. People. That’s all.
People are never just nothing. Never.
There are some people I hate.
That’d do you more harm than any bottle of acid.
Acid only burns your face.
Only....
Like a bomb only blew up my leg. There’s worse
things can happen. You can burn yourself away
inside.
After I’d come home, one person said, “He’d have
been better off stopping in there. In the hospital.
He’d be better off with others like himself.” She
thinks blind people only ought to be with other
blind people and idiot boys with idiot boys.
And people with no legs altogether?
That’s right.
What kind of a world would that be?
At least there’d be nobody to stare at you because
you weren’t like them.
So you think you’re just the same as all the other
people with burned faces? Just by what you look
like? Ah....everything’s different. Everything’s the
same, but everything is different. Itself.
How do you make all that out?
Watching. Listening. Thinking.
I’d like a place like this. A garden. I’d like a house
with no curtains.
The gate’s always open.
But this isn’t mine.
Everything’s yours if you want it. What’s mine is
anybody’s.
So I could come here again? Even if you were
out....I could come here.
Certainly. You might find others here, of course.
Oh....
Well, that needn’t stop you, you needn’t mind.
It’d stop them. They’d mind me. When they saw
me here. They look at my face and run.

Reading with Insight
1.

What is it that draws Derry towards Mr Lamb
inspite of himself?

2.

In which section of the play does Mr Lamb display
signs of loneliness and disappointment? What are
the ways in which Mr Lamb tries to overcome
these feelings?

3.

The actual pain or inconvenience caused by a
physical impairment is often much less than the
sense of alienation felt by the person with
disabilities. What is the kind of behaviour that
the person expects from others?

4.

Will Derry get back to his old seclusion or will
Mr Lamb’s brief association effect a change in
the kind of life he will lead in the future?
