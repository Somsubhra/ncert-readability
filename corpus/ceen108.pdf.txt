Mother, your baby is silly! She is so very childish!

She does not know the difference between the lights in the
streets and the bright stars.

When we play with pebbles, she thinks they are real food.
She even tries to put them into her mouth.

When I open a book before her and ask her to learn her a b c,
she tears the pages with her hands and roars with joy at nothing.
This is your baby’s way of doing her lessons!

When I shake my head at her in anger and scold her, or call
her naughty, she laughs and thinks it great fun.
Everybody knows that Father is away, but sometimes I call
out "Father" playfully. She looks quickly about her in excitement
and thinks that Father is near.

no

Sometimes I hold a class with the donkeys that our
washerman brings to carry away the dirty clothes. I warn her
that I am the schoolmaster and that she better not make any
noise. Only then she keeps quiet. I insist that she should call me
“dada”.
Your baby wants to catch the moon. She is really funny.
Mother, your baby is silly. She is so very childish!
Rabindranath Tagore

l
Let them also read and enjoy the poem silently.
l
Encourage

children to guess the meanings of difficult words, before you

explain.

l
Ask the children to bring one inland letter each. Show them on the blackboard

where to write the date, address etc. using the new format, where the address,
date, and the name of the letter writer are aligned on the left hand margin. Ask
them to write a letter with a proper beginning and ending. This can also be
done in pairs.
l
If it is possible, arrange a visit to the local post office.
l
Children

can also make greeting cards with colourful drawings. Encourage
them to fold paper in different ways to make cards, e.g. a card with a border, a
card opening in the middle, a card folded into four and so on.

Discuss
l

the different forms of communication like telephone, telegram, email
etc. with advantages and disadvantages of each.

You should enjoy telling the story. The teacher does not tell it merely to inform,
l
enlighten or amuse but because it is something so good, so
delightful. You must remember that to be friends with your
story you must grasp it, feel it, and share it with the children.
Let children
l

talk about their brothers, sisters, cousins etc.
Bring out the concept of caring and sharing, and emotional
bonding within families.
