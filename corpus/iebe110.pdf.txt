10. Kathmandu
BEFORE YOU READ
•

Do you like travelling? The writer, Vikram Seth, enjoys it very
much. In his book, Heaven Lake, he describes a long journey
from China to India, via Tibet and Nepal.

•

Have you heard of places like Ajmer Sharif, Madurai, Sanchi,
Varanasi, Sarnath, or Halebid? Can you name some other
places like these?

•

What do the surroundings of a holy place in your city look
like? Think about it as you read Vikram Seth’s description of
Kathmandu.

GET a cheap room in the centre of town and sleep
for hours. The next morning, with Mr Shah’s son
and nephew, I visit the two temples in Kathmandu
that are most sacred to Hindus and Buddhists.
2.
At Pashupatinath (outside which a sign
proclaims ‘Entrance for the Hindus only’) there is
an atmosphere of ‘febrile confusion’. Priests,
hawkers, devotees, tourists, cows, monkeys, pigeons
and dogs roam through the grounds. We offer a few
flowers. There are so many worshippers that some
people trying to get the priest’s attention are elbowed
aside by others pushing their way to the front. A
princess of the Nepalese royal house appears;
everyone bows and makes way. By the main gate, a
party of saf fron-clad Wester ners struggle for
permission to enter. The policeman is not convinced
that they are ‘the Hindus’ (only Hindus are allowed
to enter the temple). A fight breaks out between
two monkeys. One chases the other, who jumps
onto a shivalinga, then runs screaming around the
temples and down to the river, the holy Bagmati,

that flows below. A corpse is being cremated on its
banks; washerwomen are at their work and children
bathe. From a balcony a basket of flowers and
leaves, old offerings now wilted, is dropped into the
river. A small shrine half protrudes from the stone
platform on the river bank. When it emerges fully,
the goddess inside will escape, and the evil period
of the Kaliyug will end on earth.

shrine: a place of
worship

At the Baudhnath stupa, the Buddhist shrine of
Kathmandu, there is, in contrast, a sense of
stillness. Its immense white dome is ringed by a
road. Small shops stand on its outer edge: many of
these are owned by Tibetan immigrants; felt bags,
Tibetan prints and silver jewellery can be bought
here. There are no crowds: this is a haven of
quietness in the busy streets around.
4.
Kathmandu is vivid, mercenary, religious, with
small shrines to flower-adorned deities along the
narrowest and busiest streets; with fruit sellers,
flute sellers, hawkers of postcards; shops selling
Western cosmetics, film rolls and chocolate; or
copper utensils and Nepalese antiques. Film songs
blare out from the radios, car horns sound, bicycle
bells ring, stray cows low questioningly at
motorcycles, vendors shout out their wares. I indulge

myself mindlessly: buy a bar of marzipan, a cornon-the-cob roasted in a charcoal brazier on the
pavement (rubbed with salt, chilli powder and
lemon); a couple of love story comics, and even a
Reader’s Digest. All this I wash down with Coca Cola
and a nauseating orange drink, and feel much the
better for it.
5.
I consider what route I should take back home.
If I were propelled by enthusiasm for travel per se,
I would go by bus and train to Patna, then sail up
the Ganges past Benaras to Allahabad, then up the
Yamuna, past Agra to Delhi. But I am too exhausted
and homesick; today is the last day of August. Go
home, I tell myself: move directly towards home. I
enter a Nepal Airlines office and buy a ticket for
tomorrow’s flight.
6.
I look at the flute seller standing in a corner of
the square near the hotel. In his hand is a pole
with an attachment at the top from which fifty or
sixty bansuris protrude in all directions, like the
quills of a porcupine. They are of bamboo: there are
cross-flutes and recorders. From time to time he
stands the pole on the ground, selects a flute and
plays for a few minutes. The sound rises clearly
above the noise of the traffic and the hawkers’ cries.
He plays slowly, meditatively, without excessive
display. He does not shout out his wares.
Occasionally he makes a sale, but in a curiously
offhanded way as if this were incidental to his
enterprise. Sometimes he breaks off playing to talk
to the fruit seller. I imagine that this has been the
pattern of his life for years.
7.
I find it difficult to tear myself away from the
square. Flute music always does this to me: it is at
once the most universal and most particular of
sounds. There is no culture that does not have its
flute — the reed neh, the recorder, the Japanese
shakuhachi, the deep bansuri of Hindustani classical
music, the clear or breathy flutes of South America,

me, to be drawn into the commonality of all
mankind, to be moved by music closest in its
phrases and sentences to the human voice. Its
motive force too is living breath: it too needs to
pause and breathe before it can go on.
8.
That I can be so affected by a few familiar phrases
on the bansuri, surprises me at first, for on the
previous occasions that I have returned home after
a long absence abroad, I have hardly noticed such
details, and certainly have not invested them with
the significance I now do.

IV. Simple Present Tense
Study these sentences from the lesson.
• A fight breaks out between two monkeys.
• Film songs blare out from the radios.
• I wash it down with Coca-Cola.
The italicised verbs are in the simple present tense. The writer is here describing
what he saw and heard but he uses the present tense instead of the past tense.
A narration or a story can be made more dramatic or immediate by using the
present tense in this way.

d
e
h
s

Now look at the following sentences.
• A small shrine half protrudes from the stone platform on the riverbank.
• Small shops stand on the outer edge of the Stupa.

We use the simple present tense to speak about what is usually or generally
true. The sentences above describe facts. We also use the simple present tense
in sentences depicting ‘universal truths’. For example:
• The sun rises in the east.
• The earth revolves round the sun.
We can also refer to habitual actions using the simple present tense.
• He usually takes a train instead of a bus to work.
• We often get fine drizzles in winter.
In these sentences words like everyday, often, seldom, never, every month,
generally, usually, etc. may be used.
1. Fill in the blanks with the correct form of the verb in brackets.

one of them.

2. Imagine you are giving an eyewitness account or a running commentary of
one of the following:

Speak a few sentences narrating what you see and hear. Use the simple
present and the present continuous tenses. For example:
• He passes the ball but Ben gets in the way ...
• These brave soldiers guard our frontiers. They display their skills here ...

A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal
This poem is about the death of a loved one. How does the
poet feel when he thinks about her death? How does he
imagine her to be, after death?

A slumber did my spirit seal—
I had no human fears.
She seemed a thing that could not feel
The touch of earthy years.
No motion has she now, no force—
She neither hears nor sees,
Rolled round in earth’s diurnal course
With rocks and stones and trees.

Thinking about the Poem

1. “A slumber did my spirit seal,” says the poet. That is, a deep sleep ‘closed
off ’ his soul (or mind). How does the poet react to his loved one’s death? Does
he feel bitter grief ? Or does he feel a great peace?

o
n

2. The passing of time will no longer affect her, says the poet. Which lines of
the poem say this?
3. How does the poet imagine her to be, after death? Does he think of her as a
person living in a very happy state (a ‘heaven’)? Or does he see her now as a
part of nature? In which lines of the poem do you find your answer?

Fear No More
Fear no more the heat o’ the sun,
Nor the furious winter’s rages;
Thou thy worldly task hast done,
Home art gone, and ta’en thy wages:
Golden lads and girls all must,
As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.

Fear no more the frown o’ the great,
Thou art past the tyrant’s stroke;
Care no more to clothe and eat;
To thee the reed is as the oak:
The sceptre, learning, physic, must
All follow this, and come to dust.
Fear no more lightning-flash,
Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;
Fear not slander, censure rash;
Thou hast finished joy and moan:
All lovers young, all lovers must
Consign to thee, and come to dust.

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE

o
n

Theresa Kane says that she likes this poem ... because it is so
exhilarating. It sweeps me along in the splendid, stormy words,
then there is the quiet, peaceful lagoon of the last two lines of each
verse. It is a wonderful poem, as hard, proud and fierce as a rock
in a storm.
