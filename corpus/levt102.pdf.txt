have no intention of pretending to advance only to end in a
strategic withdrawal. Even the threat of a Stuka bomber
will not throw me off track. The Stuka, if it likes, can beat
a hasty retreat from my story.
Right at the start, it is imperative to disclose a matter
of vital importance about the Tiger King. Everyone who
reads of him will experience the natural desire to meet a
man of his indomitable courage face-to-face. But there is
no chance of its fulfilment. As Bharata said to Rama about

Dasaratha, the Tiger King has reached that final abode of
all living creatures. In other words, the Tiger King is dead.
The manner of his death is a matter of extraordinary
interest. It can be revealed only at the end of the tale. The
most fantastic aspect of his demise was that as soon as he
was born, astrologers had foretold that one day the Tiger
King would actually have to die.
“The child will grow up to become the warrior of
warriors, hero of heroes, champion of champions. But...”
they bit their lips and swallowed hard. When compelled to
continue, the astrologers came out with it. “This is a secret
which should not be revealed at all. And yet we are forced
to speak out. The child born under this star will one day
have to meet its death.”
At that very moment a great miracle took place. An
astonishing phrase emerged from the lips of the ten-dayold Jilani Jung Jung Bahadur, “O wise prophets!’’
Everyone stood transfixed in stupefaction. They looked
wildly at each other and blinked.
‘‘O wise prophets! It was I who spoke.’’
This time there were no grounds for doubt. It was the
infant born just ten days ago who had enunciated the words
so clearly.
The chief astrologer took off his spectacles and gazed
intently at the baby.
‘‘All those who are born will one day have to die. We
don’t need your predictions to know that. There would be
some sense in it if you could tell us the manner of that
death,’’ the royal infant uttered these words in his little
squeaky voice.
The chief astrologer placed his finger on his nose in
wonder. A baby barely ten days old opens its lips in speech!
Not only that, it also raises intelligent questions! Incredible!
Rather like the bulletins issued by the war office, than facts.
The chief astrologer took his finger off his nose and
fixed his eyes upon the little prince.
‘‘The prince was born in the hour of the Bull. The Bull
and the Tiger are enemies, therefore, death comes from
the Tiger,’’ he explained.

You may think that crown prince Jung Jung Bahadur
was thrown into a quake when he heard the word ‘Tiger’.
That was exactly what did not happen. As soon as he heard
it pronounced, the crown prince gave a deep growl. Terrifying
words emerged from his lips.
‘‘Let tigers beware!’’
This account is only a rumour rife in Pratibandapuram.
But with hindsight we may conclude it was based on some
truth.

Crown prince Jung Jung Bahadur
grew taller and stronger day by day. No
other miracle marked his childhood days
apart from the event already described.

films — exactly as the crown princes of
all the other Indian states did. When he
came of age at twenty, the State, which had been with the
Court of Wards until then, came into his hands.
But everyone in the kingdom remembered the
astrologer’s prediction. Many continued to discuss the
matter. Slowly it came to the Maharaja’s ears.
There were innumerable forests in the Pratibandapuram
State. They had tigers in them. The Maharaja knew the old
saying, ‘You may kill even a cow in self-defence’. There could
certainly be no objection to killing tigers in self-defence.
The Maharaja started out on a tiger hunt.
The Maharaja was thrilled beyond measure when he
killed his first tiger. He sent for the State astrologer and
showed him the dead beast.
‘‘What do you say now?’’ he demanded.
‘‘Your majesty may kill ninety-nine tigers in exactly
the same manner. But...’’ the astrologer drawled.
‘‘But what? Speak without fear.’’
“But you must be very careful with the hundredth tiger.’’

‘‘What if the hundredth tiger were also killed?’’
‘‘Then I will tear up all my books on astrology, set fire
to them, and…’’
‘‘And…’’
‘‘I shall cut off my tuft, crop my hair short and become
an insurance agent,’’ the astrologer finished on an
incoherent note.

From that day onwards it was celebration time for all
the tigers inhabiting Pratibandapuram.
The State banned tiger hunting by anyone except the
Maharaja. A proclamation was issued to the effect that if
anyone dared to fling so much as a stone at a tiger, all his
wealth and property would be confiscated.
The Maharaja vowed he would attend to all other
matters only after killing the hundred tigers. Initially the
king seemed well set to realise his ambition.
Not that he faced no dangers. There were times when
the bullet missed its mark, the tiger leapt upon him and
he fought the beast with his bare hands. Each time it was
the Maharaja who won.

At another time he was in danger of losing his throne.
A high-ranking British officer visited Pratibandapuram.
He was very fond of hunting tigers. And fonder of being
photographed with the tigers he had shot. As usual, he
wished to hunt tigers in Pratibandapuram. But the
Maharaja was firm in his resolve. He refused permission.
‘‘I can organise any other hunt. You may go on a boar
hunt. You may conduct a mouse hunt. We are ready for a
mosquito hunt. But tiger hunt! That’s impossible!’’
The British officer’s secretary sent word to the
Maharaja through the dewan that the durai himself did
not have to kill the tiger. The Maharaja could do the actual
killing. What was important to the durai was a photograph
of himself holding the gun and standing over the tiger’s
carcass. But the Maharaja would not agree even to this
proposal. If he relented now, what would he do if other
British officers turned up for tiger hunts?
Because he prevented a British officer from fulfilling
his desire, the Maharaja stood in danger of losing his
kingdom itself.
The Maharaja and the dewan held deliberations over
this issue. As a result, a telegram was despatched forthwith
to a famous British company of jewellers in Calcutta. ‘Send
samples of expensive diamond rings of different designs.’
Some fifty rings arrived. The Maharaja sent the whole
lot to the British officer’s good lady. The king and the minister
expected the duraisani to choose one or two rings and send
the rest back. Within no time at all the duraisani sent her
reply: ‘Thank you very much for your gifts.’
In two days a bill for three lakh of rupees came from
the British jewellers. The Maharaja was happy that though
he had lost three lakh of rupees, he had managed to retain
his kingdom.

The Maharaja’s tiger hunts continued to be highly
successful. Within ten years he was able to kill seventy
tigers. And then, an unforeseen hurdle brought his mission
to a standstill. The tiger population became extinct in the

forests of Pratibandapuram. Who knows whether the tigers
practised birth control or committed harakiri? Or simply
ran away from the State because they desired to be shot
by British hands alone?
One day the Maharaja sent for the
dewan. ‘‘Dewan saheb, aren’t you aware
of the fact that thirty tigers still remain
to be shot down by this gun of mine?’’ he
asked brandishing his gun.

to kill?
“You are neither tiger nor gun.
Dewan saheb, I summoned you here for
a different purpose. I have decided to get married.’’
The dewan began to babble even more. ‘‘Your Majesty,
I have two wives already. If I marry you ...’’
‘‘Don’t talk nonsense! Why should I marry you? What I
want is a tiger...’’
‘‘Your Majesty! Please think it over. Your ancestors
were married to the sword. If you like, marry the gun. A
Tiger King is more than enough for this state. It doesn’t
need a Tiger Queen as well!’’
The Maharaja gave a loud crack of laughter. ‘‘I’m not
thinking of marrying either a tiger or a gun, but a girl from
the ranks of human beings. First you may draw up statistics
of tiger populations in the different native states. Next you
may investigate if there is a girl I can marry in the royal
family of a state with a large tiger population.’’
The dewan followed his orders. He found the right girl
from a state which possessed a large number of tigers.
Maharaja Jung Jung Bahadur killed five or six tigers
each time he visited his father-in-law. In this manner,
ninety-nine tiger skins adorned the walls of the reception
hall in the Pratibandapuram palace.

The Maharaja’s anxiety reached a
fever pitch when there remained just one
tiger to achieve his tally of a hundred.

his fate?
But he had to be extremely careful
with that last tiger. What had the late
chief astrologer said? “Even after killing ninety-nine tigers
the Maharaja should beware of the hundredth...’’ True
enough. The tiger was a savage beast after all. One had to
be wary of it. But where was that hundredth tiger to be
found? It seemed easier to find tiger’s milk than a live tiger.
Thus the Maharaja was sunk in gloom. But soon came
the happy news which dispelled that gloom. In his own state
sheep began to disappear frequently from a hillside village.
It was first ascertained that this was not the work of
Khader Mian Saheb or Virasami Naicker, both famed for
their ability to swallow sheep whole. Surely, a tiger was at
work. The villagers ran to inform the Maharaja. The
Maharaja announced a three-year exemption from all taxes
for that village and set out on the hunt at once.
The tiger was not easily found. It seemed as if it had
wantonly hid itself in order to flout the Maharaja’s will.
The Maharaja was equally determined. He refused to
leave the forest until the tiger was found. As the days
passed, the Maharaja’s fury and obstinacy mounted
alarmingly. Many officers lost their jobs.
One day when his rage was at its height, the Maharaja
called the dewan and ordered him to double the land tax
forthwith.

‘‘The people will become discontented. Then our state
too will fall a prey to the Indian National Congress.’’
‘‘In that case you may resign from your post,’’ said the
king.
The dewan went home convinced that if the Maharaja
did not find the tiger soon, the results could be catastrophic.
He felt life returning to him only when he saw the tiger
which had been brought from the People’s Park in Madras
and kept hidden in his house.
At midnight when the town slept in peace, the dewan
and his aged wife dragged the tiger to the car and shoved
it into the seat. The dewan himself drove the car straight
to the forest where the Maharaja was hunting. When they
reached the forest the tiger launched its satyagraha and
refused to get out of the car. The dewan was thoroughly
exhausted in his efforts to haul the beast out of the car
and push it down to the ground.
On the following day, the same old tiger wandered
into the Maharaja’s presence and stood as if in humble
supplication, “Master, what do you command of me?’’ It
was with boundless joy that the Maharaja took careful
aim at the beast. The tiger fell in a crumpled heap.
‘‘I have killed the hundredth tiger. My vow has been
fulfilled,’’ the Maharaja was overcome with elation.
Ordering the tiger to be brought to the
capital in grand procession, the
Maharaja hastened away in his car.
After the Maharaja left, the hunters
went to take a closer look at the tiger. The

Then, as commanded by the king, the dead tiger was
taken in procession through the town and buried. A tomb
was erected over it.
A few days later the Maharaja’s son’s third birthday
was celebrated. Until then the Maharaja had given his
entire mind over to tiger hunting. He had had no time to
spare for the crown prince. But now the king turned his
attention to the child. He wished to give him some special
gift on his birthday. He went to the shopping centre in
Pratibandapuram and searched every shop, but couldn’t
find anything suitable. Finally he spotted a wooden tiger
in a toyshop and decided it was the perfect gift.
The wooden tiger cost only two annas and a quarter.
But the shopkeeper knew that if he quoted such a low
price to the Maharaja, he would be punished under the
rules of the Emergency. So, he said, ‘‘Your Majesty, this is
an extremely rare example of craftsmanship. A bargain at
three hundred rupees!’’
‘‘Very good. Let this be your offering to the crown prince
on his birthday,’’ said the king and took it away with him.
On that day father and son
played with that tiny little
wooden tiger. It had

been carved by an unskilled carpenter. Its surface was
rough; tiny slivers of wood stood up like quills all over it.
One of those slivers pierced the Maharaja’s right hand. He
pulled it out with his left hand and continued to play with
the prince.
The next day, infection flared in the Maharaja’s right
hand. In four days, it developed into a suppurating sore
which spread all over the arm.
Three famous surgeons were brought in from Madras.
After holding a consultation they decided to operate. The
operation took place.
The three surgeons who performed it came out of the
theatre and announced, “The operation was successful.
The Maharaja is dead.”
In this manner the hundredth tiger took its final revenge
upon the Tiger King.
