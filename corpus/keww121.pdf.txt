Ode to a Nightingale
John Keats

My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness
pains
My sense, as though of hemlock I had
drunk,
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
One minute past, and Lethe-wards had
sunk:
’Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
But being too happy in thine happiness,
That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees,
In some melodious plot
Of beechen green, and shadows
numberless,
Singest of summer in full-throated ease.

Lethe: in ancient
Greek mythology, an
imaginary
river
whose water, when
drunk, was thought
to make the dead
forget their life on
Earth.
Dryad: in stories, a
female spirit that lives
in a tree.

O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been
Cool’d a long age in the deep-delved earth,
Tasting of Flora and the country green,
Dance, and Provencal song, and sunburnt
mirth!
O, for a beaker full of the warm South,
Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,
With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,
And purple-stained mouth;
That I might drink, and leave the world
unseen,
And with thee fade away into the forest
dim.

Provencal:
(pronounced
Provensaal) of the
district of Provence
in France, known for
its bards and its
grapevines.

Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget
What thou among the leaves hast never
known
The weariness, the fever, and the fret
Here, where men sit and hear each other
groan;
Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray
hairs,
Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin,
and dies;
Where but to think is to be full of sorrow
And leaden-eyed despairs,
Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous
eyes,
Or new Love pine at them beyond tomorrow.

***

Hippocrene:
a
fountain in Mount
Helicon associated
with poetry; in the
poem it refers to the
wine that inspires
poetic ability.

Ode to a Nightingale

137

Thou wast not born for death, immortal
Bird!
No hungry generations tread thee down;
The voice I hear this passing night was
heard
In ancient days by emperor and clown:
Perhaps the self-same song that found a
path
Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick
for home,
She stood in tears amid the alien corn;
The same that oft-times hath
Charm’d magic casements, opening on the
foam
Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.

Ruth: a woman in the
Bible who left her

of
her
husband, marries
Boaz and is the
ancestor of King
David.

Forlorn! the very word is like a bell
To toll me back from thee to my sole self!
Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well
As she is fam’d to do, deceiving elf.
Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades
Past the near meadows, over the still
stream,
Up the hill-side; and now ’tis buried deep
In the next valley-glades:
Was it a vision, or a waking dream?
Fled is that music:—Do I wake or sleep?

ABOUT THE POET
John Keats (1795–1821) was one of the
greatest of the younger generation of
‘English Romantic’ poets. He started his
career as an apprentice to a surgeon but

138

Woven words

soon gave it up for poetry. His poetic career lasted for only
four years but, during this short span, he evolved from an
ordinary poet to an exceptionally mature poetic force. His
poetry celebrates beauty, which he considered the ultimate
truth. It is portrayed in extremely sensuous images that
have been created through beautiful verbal pictures. The
image of the nightingale’s bower in the poem is an apt
illustration of the poet’s craft in this respect.
