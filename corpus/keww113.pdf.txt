Foreheads of houses.
A thrush sings,

Laurel-surrounded

In the deep bare garden,
Its fresh-peeled voice

Astonishing the brickwork.
It will be spring soon,

It will be spring soon—

And I, whose childhood
Is a forgotten boredom,
Feel like a child

Who comes on a scene
Of adult reconciling,

o
n

And can understand nothing
But the unusual laughter,
And starts to be happy.

Woven Words

ABOUT THE POET
Philip Larkin (1922–1985) was born in Coventry,
England. He is well-known as a leader of
‘Movement’ in English Poetry in the fifties. The
principal works of Philip Larkin are The North
Ship, The Less Deceived, The Whitsun Weddings
and High Windows. His themes—love, change,
disenchantment, the mystery, the inexplicableness of the
poet’s survival and death’s inevitability—are universally
liked by the readers. The above poem has been taken from
the volume, The Less Deceived, which establishes a kinship
with the environment.

COBRA

His jewelled crown
and hypnotic sway enthral;
beware the lethal fangs.
NIGHT

Clouds appear
and bring to men a chance to rest
looking at the moon.
ALONE

Won’t you come and see
loneliness? Just one leaf
from the Kiri tree.
