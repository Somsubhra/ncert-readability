Before you read

Here are some pictorial glimpses of the history of our
country from 1757 to 1857. These pictures and
‘speech bubbles’ will help clarify your understanding
of the conditions that led to the event known as the
First War of Independence in 1857.

1. The Martyrs

Let your eyes fill with tears,
as you recall the sacrifices of
India’s martyrs.

2. The Company’s conquests (1757-1849)
With its superior weapons, the British
East India Company was extending its
power in 18th century India.

Indian princes were short-sighted.

Bah! Call the English
merchants. They will
help me to defeat him.

The rivalries helped the East India Company
and it could easily subdue Indian princes
one by one.

Thank God, there is peace
in the country now! No
more wars and no looting
by thugs !

How did Indians react to these conquests?
Our destiny
is linked
with them!

The white man has
killed or dethroned
our kings.

A far-seeing ruler like the
brave Tipu of Mysore
fought the British till he
died fighting!

Some kings were not
good, but after all,
they were of this land.

It is God
who sent
the British!

Now we have
become slaves

3. British Rule (1765-1836)
Religious leaders preached ideas like untouchability and child marriage.
Anyone who crosses the
seas loses his religion.

The truth was that Indians had lost self-respect.
The British scorned them.

Being merchants, the British wanted quick profits, their
heavy taxes forced farmers to abandon their fields.
But your men are
taking all my crop!

You are still in
arrears. If you don’t
pay next week. I will
send you to jail.

The natives are
unworthy of trust,
incapable of
honesty–

True, your honour,
but I am honest.

Inevitably famines followed. Between 1822 and
1836 fifteen lakh Indians died of starvation.

Still, the British invented other methods
which gave them more profits.

The British policies
ruined the expert
artisans and their
business.

4. Ram Mohan Roy (1772-1833)
Ram Mohan Roy, a learned man from Bengal,
understood what was wrong with the country.
Let us not despise ourselves, our ancient culture is
great. And we are capable of greater achievements.
We must first reform our society.
Superstitions have been
ruining us.

He told his wife Uma–
Cows are of different colours, but
the colour of their milk is the
same. Different teachers have
different opinions but the essence
of every religion is the same.

He was attracted by
science and modern
knowledge.

Knowledge should
be practical and
scientific.

He crossed the seas and
went to England to see what
made the British powerful.
There he told them–

We accept you as rulers,
and you must accept us
as subjects. But you
must remember the
responsibility a ruler
owes to his subjects.

He started
newspapers but
the suspicious
British stopped
them in 1823.

5. Oppression (1765-1835)
But the British continued to oppress Indians. In
1818, they had passed Regulation III. Under it, an
Indian could be jailed without trial in a court.

All the time British officers in India
drew big salaries and also made
fortunes in private business.

The British prospered on
the Company’s loot
while Indian industries
began to die.

6. Dissatisfaction (1835-56)
Education in India was in Persian and
Sanskrit. In 1835, a Englishman named
Macaulay suggested a change.

English education produced clerks to whom the British gave petty
jobs under them. Incidentally, it also produced a new generation
of intellectuals.
We must
educate our
brothers.

We should teach the
natives through the
English language.

And try to
improve their
material
conditions.

For that we must
convey our grievances
to the British
Parliament.

I agree.

7. The Sparks (1855-57)
Taxes continued to ruin the peasants. In
Bengal, the Santhals who had lost their lands
under new land rules, became desperate. In
1855, they rose in rebellion and massacred
Europeans and their supporters alike.

Discontent was brewing in the East India Company’s army too.

History becomes fun at this school
Mumbai: Students in the sixth grade of a certain school in Navi Mumbai love
their history lessons thanks to a novel teaching aid. It is not surprising given
the fact that their study material includes comic books and they use their
textbooks for reference to put things into perspective. Besides, students are
encouraged to tap other sources of information as well. During history classes,
students pore over comic strips of historical periods, enact characters of
emperors and tyrants, and have animated discussions on the subject. History
has become fun.
In the class students are asked to read the comic strip aloud, after which
they break up into groups of four, discuss what they have heard and write a
summary. Each group leader reads his group's summary aloud and the
whole class jumps into discussion and debate, adding points, disagreeing
and qualifying points of view. A sixth grade student says, “It’s a lot of fun
because everyone gets a chance to express themselves and the summary
takes everyone's ideas into account.”
According to the school principal the comic strip format and visuals appeal
to students. A historian feels that using comics in schools is a great idea.
Comics and acting help students understand what characters in the story
are actually thinking.

new method of teaching history.
4. Find the chapters in your history book that correspond to the episodes and
events described in this comic. Note how the information contained in a few
chapters of history has been condensed to a few pages with the help of pictures
and ‘speech bubbles’.
5. Create a comic of your own using this story.
Once the Sun and the Wind began to quarrel, each one saying that he
was stronger than the other. At last they decided to test each other’s
strength. A man with a cloak around his shoulders was passing by.
The Wind boasted, “Using my strength I can make that man take off
the cloak.” The Sun agreed. The Wind blew hard. The man felt so cold
that he clasped his cloak round his body as tightly as possible.
Now it was the turn of the Sun which shone very hot indeed. The
man felt so hot that he at once removed the cloak from his body.
Seeing the man taking off the cloak, the Wind conceded defeat.

Macavity : The Mystery Cat
Do you have a pet cat? Have you ever noticed anything
mysterious about it? It is not easy to say whether every cat is a
mystery, but Macavity is one, for sure. What is it that makes
him a perfect mystery cat? Read the poem and find out.

Macavity’s a Mystery Cat: he’s called the Hidden
Paw —
For he’s the master criminal who can defy the Law.
He’s the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad’s
despair:
For when they reach the scene of crime — Macavity’s
not there!

Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like
Macavity,
He’s broken every human law, he breaks
the law of gravity.
His powers of levitation would make a fakir
stare,
And when you reach the scene of crime
— Macavity’s not there!
You may seek him in the basement, you
may look up in the air —
But I tell you once and once again,
Macavity’s not there!

o
n

Macavity’s a ginger cat, he’s very tall and
thin;
You would know him if you saw him, for
his eyes are sunken in.
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his
head is highly domed;

His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed.
He sways his head from side to side, with movements
like a snake;
And when you think he’s half asleep, he’s always wide awake.
Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,
For he’s a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity.
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in
the square —
But when a crime’s discovered, then Macavity’s not there!
