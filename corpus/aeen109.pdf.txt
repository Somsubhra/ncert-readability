Anandi's Rainbow
Enjoy this nature story
It was raining outside.
Anandi was fast asleep
dreaming of rainbows.
She woke up to look out
of her window. There
was a huge, bright
rainbow across a clear
blue sky.
Anandi ran out to the
garden with Milli, her
favourite cat.

Anandi loved to draw
and paint. Today, she
wanted to paint the
flowers of her garden
with the colours of the
rainbow.
She coloured one
flower with the violet,
and another with the
indigo of the rainbow.
One with the blue and
leaves with the green...
One with the orange...

103

One with the
red...
But she left
the yellow so
that the Sun
may look bright and gay...
And lo! There were
beautiful flowers all over
the garden. The
Sun was up there
shining in its

Story — Anandi’s Rainbow

UNIT

Teacher's Page

9

The idea in this Unit is to assist the children in building their imagination;
making and speaking simple sentences; and writing at least a few sentences.
The sentences can be made both from the text and from their environment,
using the sight words and flash cards in their classroom or outdoors.
4
Develop reading skills
Let the children do the activity of odd one out. Encourage them to spot
the one that is different. For example, draw a sequence of objects such as
flowers and make one flower slightly different. Ask the children to point
out the one that is different. These kinds of activities are relevant to
reading as they help them identify and discriminate between objects and
pictures.
Alphabet cards can be used for the matching exercise. The teacher
makes cards from a to z in capitals and in lower case. The child has to
match the capital letter with the corresponding one in lower case. For
example, A with a and B with b.
4
Group activity
Make a calender for every month showing birthdays of every child and
display it along with this traditional song:
Thirty days hath September,
April, June, and November,
All the rest have thirty-one,
Excepting February alone.
4
Develop pronunciation
Have a recitation or reading session of the poem ‘Clouds’. Let each child
be given a chance to read. The more confident he feels, the more
motivated he will be to continue in his efforts.
Have a reading session of the story ‘Anandi’s Rainbow’ from the Unit.
Let each child be given a few lines to read.
Develop speaking skills
4
Discuss with them the following questions
l
How many days has September?
l
Does February have 30 days in the month?
l
How many months have thirty days?
l
How many months have thirty-one days?
l
When is your birthday?
l
How many children in the class have a birthday in each month?
Ask the class to repeat sentences like: ‘It’s cold’, ‘It’s raining today’,
