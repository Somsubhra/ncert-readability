Neha’s Alarm Clock
Narrator : Ring! Ring! Ring! Off goes the alarm clock at six in
the morning. Neha makes a face and covering her ears with a
pillow, snuggles under the warm blanket. But she knows she
has to get up. She mutters to herself.
Neha : This alarm clock always rings at six and pulls me out
of the bed! It’s so unfair...Oh, how I would love to sleep a
little longer in the morning! I wish this clock would forget its
job sometimes.
Narrator : Something falls. Neha smiles.
Neha : Oh!
My clock has
fallen. How
happy I am!
Tomorrow I
can get up
late.
Narrator :
Next morning
there is no
alarm. So
Neha sleeps
and sleeps.

chirpy birds

which come to the window sill every morning find
Neha still sleeping.
Birds : Wake up dear! Wake up fast!
Narrator : Neha gets up with a start.
Neha : Oh, no. If it’s not the alarm clock, it’s these
birds… why don’t they leave me alone?
Narrator : Even this wish of Neha’s comes true. The
next morning there is not only no alarm clock, there
are no birds either. But there is someone else who
does not want her to miss the school bus. Can you
guess who it is? The big bright Sun! He fills Neha’s
room with a warm smile.

Neha : Oh, my eyes! Now it’s the Sun waking me
up! Why can’t he let me be?
Narrator : Even this wish of Neha’s comes true.
Next morning the Sun is behind the
clouds. So, Neha snores till she hears
her mother’s voice...
Mother : Wake up, sleepy head.
You will miss the bus.
Neha : Oh no. Why does
mother have to
wake me up?
Narrator :
There is no
escape now.
Neha gets up and
gets ready. Can
you imagine
what happens
the next day?
Neha wakes up
with a start. Her
watch says it is
six o’clock. She
calls out to her
mother.
Neha : Ma, who woke
me up today?

Appreciating nature

Teacher's page

Poem : Wake up!
Story : Neha’s Alarm Clock

This Unit focuses on appreciation of the beauty in poetry, the magic of words and to give
children experiences in expressing their feelings. This Unit is also a listening unit – it gives
children something to listen to as you read the poem to them. Ask children why they like the
poem and read the poem again for interesting and beautiful sounds. Begin this unit by
pointing to the pictures and ask children what beautiful colours they see. Provide print rich
environment.

d
e

Warm up

It is important to do warm up exercises related to the theme, like, let children stretch their
arms, exercise and jog as if to wake up wide. Relate this to the natural beauty of the morning.

Reading time

Read the chapter to the students at a stretch, giving the meanings of the new and difficult
words so that they can understand the text. Use appropriate words, expressions, phrases in
different situations. This can help you to assess the child’s ability to listen with attention
for a reasonable length of time, share the main idea of the text and accelerate recall skills.
Give the children a chance to read individually.
Sharing time

Involve the class, in a group reading session. Let children add meaning with voice
modulation and body gestures.
Dramatise the play for the morning assembly. Let each child express what they feel when
they have to get up in the morning.
Team time

l
Play memory games. You can write down ten new words from the lesson on the
blackboard. Let the children look at the words for two minutes. Ask the children to close
their eyes. You can then erase one word. The children will then open their eyes and
identify the word that has been erased.
l
Since breakfast is important for good health, each child could be asked what he had for
breakfast. Then ask them to give the importance of milk, lassi, butter. Let them add what
they eat / will like to eat.

o
n

l
Discuss the importance of time and punctuality with the class. While discussing other
ways of finding time, the sun dial, shadows and position of sun can be introduced.
Environment

Create a Junior Green Brigade as a group of keen environmentalists who assist in keeping
the school green and clean; they can be actively involved in successful projects against
crackers and banning the use of polybags in the school and community. The school can
encourage cloth bags which are an attractive and environment-friendly alternative to
plastic.
