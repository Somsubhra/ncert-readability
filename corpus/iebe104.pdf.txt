4. A TRULY BEAUTIFUL MIND

The story of Einstein tries to show him as a human being, a fairly
ordinary person who had his likes and dislikes, his streaks of rebellion,
and his problems. The class can think about how a ‘great person’ was
perceived before being recognised as ‘great’: it is not as though great
people are born with a special sign that allows us to recognise them
instantly! What qualities in a person, then, make them a genius or a
great person?

You can take the help of a science teacher to explain Einstein’s Theory
of Relativity, to talk about Einstein, and build inter-subject cooperation.
The exercise of matching headings to paragraphs in the lesson is useful
for finding the topic sentence or to scan a paragraph for specific
information. Students may be asked to provide a different heading if
they feel some other point is equally important.
Students should be guided to write a newspaper report. Note the points
given below. Illustrate them by bringing examples from newspapers into
the class, and ask students to bring their own examples.

•

A report should have:
1. A headline
2. Name of the reporter e.g. ‘By a Staff Reporter’, etc.
3. Place, date, source (the source may also be given at the end of the
report).

•

The beginning is usually an expansion of the headline. The middle
paragraph gives the details. It is followed by the conclusion or the
summing up.

•

The report should be brief, but the headline and the style should be
eye-catching.

•

Sometimes important points are given in a box in the centre of the
report.

•

Regarding the language of the reports:
1. passives for past action (for example: It is found ..., ... has been
unearthed.)

o
n

2. present tense for statements (The document contains…, The
manuscript describes…)
This unit has a passage for dictation, an anecdote. Dictation is an
exercise that requires the individual participation of each student. It
fosters unconscious thinking, and draws attention to language form.
Students can also be given opportunities for self or peer correction after
the dictation.

•

Students should first read the passage silently, noticing the use of
punctuation marks.

•

The passage to be dictated should be read aloud twice in the class
with proper intonation, and pauses between meaningful phrases.

•

The passage is read a third time for students to check through.

5. THE SNAKE

AND THE

MIRROR

‘The Snake and the Mirror’ is a complex story of self-discovery that is
humorously told. The narrator is a vain and foolish young man who in
a moment of crisis realises that he is “poor, foolish and stupid”. The
questions are designed to help the students notice the humour in the
narration.
This unit has a formal, expository passage for dictation. Students should
be encouraged to learn the spellings of unfamiliar words beforehand.
The dictation of such passages also encourages the development of
grammar in the students’ minds, as they recall complex language.
The Writing task is based on a sketch from a photograph that tells a
story. Encourage the students to read the words given alongside the
sketch. Let the students form pairs or groups to talk freely about the
sketch before they start writing.
A new kind of activity introduced in this lesson is to compare two
translations of the beginning of a story. This activity suggests to the
students that language is not ‘fixed’; there are different ways of
experiencing an idea, which also lead to small changes in the idea that
is expressed. This activity should be done as a fun activity.

6. MY CHILDHOOD
The autobiographical account of childhood embodies the themes of
harmony and prejudice, tradition and change. The questions guide the
children to identify the instances of the themes.
A map reading activity is given in this unit. Students will find out the
geographical location of Dhanushkodi and Rameswaram, and
the languages spoken at that time by different communities. This

44 / Beehive

will develop a critical understanding of how life and society in
the deep south changed and developed over the years. Dhanuskodi
and Rameswaram are on an island, the Pamban Island, off the
Tamil Nadu coast.
The dictionary work encourages children to identify the contexts, literal
and metaphorical, in which the given words occur. You may find other
such words to add to the exercise.
The dictation exercise in this unit requires the rearrangement of jumbled
paragraphs. Ideally this kind of dictation should be carried out with
passages that the students have not seen before.
The teacher dictates the three parts of the given passage, in random
order, one to each group in class, for example part two first, then part
three, and finally part one. The class has to share information in order
to put the text together in the right order. This can be a class activity
directed by the teacher.

The Speaking exercise includes an activity requiring students to ask
other people for their opinion on the topic.

7. PACKING

This is a humorous story about the confusion and mess made by
inexperienced packing. Draw the attention of the students to the antics
of Montmorency, the dog. Help students to find humorous elements in
the story such as Jerome finding his toothbrush inside the shoe and
Harris squashing the tomatoes. Draw their attention to humour in the
narration, such as “Montmorency’s ambition in life is to get in the way
and be sworn at,” or the beginning of the narration “Packing is one of
those many things that I feel I know more about than any other person
living.(It surprises me myself, sometimes, how many such things there
are.)”
An activity in this unit is to collect examples of instructions and
directions such as those given in pamphlets for different products. An
example has been provided of a pamphlet with instructions in different
foreign languages. The purpose is to encourage students to find other
such pamphlets as a fun activity.

4. A Truly Beautiful Mind
BEFORE YOU READ
•

Who do you think of, when you hear the word ‘genius’? Who
is a genius — what qualities do you think a genius has?

•

We shall now read about a young German civil servant who
took the world by storm about a hundred years ago. In the
summer of 1905, the 26-year-old published in quick succession
four ground-breaking papers: about light, the motion of
particles, the electrodynamics of moving bodies, and energy.
His work took up only a few pages in scientific journals, but
changed forever our understanding of space, time and the
entire cosmos — and transformed the name ‘Einstein’ into a
synonym for genius.

Fifty years after his death, Albert Einstein’s genius still reigns.

1. ALBERT Einstein was born on 14 March 1879 in the

German city of Ulm, without any indication that he
was destined for greatness. On the contrary, his
mother thought Albert was a freak. To her, his head
seemed much too large.
2.
At the age of two-and-a-half, Einstein still wasn’t
talking. When he finally did learn to speak, he uttered
everything twice. Einstein did not know what to do
with other children, and his playmates called him
“Brother Boring.” So the youngster played by himself

o
n

Otto Neugebauer, the historian of ancient mathematics, told a
story about the boy Einstein that he characterises as a “legend”,
but that seems fairly authentic. As he was a late talker, his parents
were worried. At last, at the supper table one night, he broke his
silence to say, “The soup is too hot.” Greatly relieved, his parents
asked why he had never said a word before. Albert replied,
“Because up to now everything was in order.”

freak: a word used
disapprovingly to talk
about a person who is
unusual and doesn’t
behave, look or think
like others

much of the time. He especially loved mechanical
toys. Looking at his newborn sister, Maja, he is said
to have said: “Fine, but where are her wheels?”
3.
A headmaster once told his father that what
Einstein chose as a profession wouldn’t matter,
because “he’ll never make a success at anything.”
Einstein began learning to play the violin at the
age of six, because his mother wanted him to; he
later became a gifted amateur violinist, maintaining
this skill throughout his life.
4.
But Albert Einstein was not a bad pupil. He
went to high school in Munich, where Einstein’s
family had moved when he was 15 months old, and
scored good marks in almost every subject. Einstein
hated the school’s regimentation, and often clashed
with his teachers. At the age of 15, Einstein felt so
stifled there that he left the school for good.
5.
The previous year, Albert’s parents had moved to
Milan, and left their son with relatives. After prolonged
discussion, Einstein got his wish to continue his
education in German-speaking Switzerland, in a city
which was more liberal than Munich.
6.
Einstein was highly gifted in mathematics and
interested in physics, and after finishing school,
he decided to study at a university in Zurich. But
science wasn’t the only thing that appealed to the
dashing young man with the walrus moustache.

He also felt a special interest in a fellow student,
Mileva Maric, whom he found to be a “clever
creature.” This young Serb had come to Switzerland
because the University in Zurich was one of the few
in Europe where women could get degrees. Einstein
saw in her an ally against the “philistines”—
those people in his family and at the university
with whom he was constantly at odds. The couple
fell in love. Letters survive in which they put their
affection into words, mixing science with
tenderness. Wrote Einstein: “How happy and proud
I shall be when we both have brought our work on
relativity to a victorious conclusion.”
8.
In 1900, at the age of 21, Albert Einstein was a
university graduate and unemployed. He worked
as a teaching assistant, gave private lessons and
finally secured a job in 1902 as a technical expert
in the patent office in Bern. While he was supposed
to be assessing other people’s inventions, Einstein
was actually developing his own ideas in secret. He
is said to have jokingly called his desk drawer at
work the “bureau of theoretical physics.”
9.
One of the famous papers of 1905 was Einstein’s
Special Theory of Relativity, according to which time
and distance are not absolute. Indeed, two perfectly
accurate clocks will not continue to show the same
time if they come together again after a journey if
one of them has been moving very fast relative to
the other. From this followed the world’s most
famous formula which describes the relationship
between mass and energy:

While Einstein was solving the most difficult
problems in physics, his private life was
unravelling. Albert had wanted to marry Mileva right
after finishing his studies, but his mother was
against it. She thought Mileva, who was three years
older than her son, was too old for him. She was
also bothered by Mileva’s intelligence. “She is a
book like you,” his mother said. Einstein put the
wedding off.
11.
The pair finally married in January 1903, and
had two sons. But a few years later, the marriage
faltered. Mileva, meanwhile, was losing her
intellectual ambition and becoming an unhappy
housewife. After years of constant fighting, the
couple finally divorced in 1919. Einstein married
his cousin Elsa the same year.

12.

Einstein’s new personal chapter coincided with
his rise to world fame. In 1915, he had published
his General Theory of Relativity, which provided a
new interpretation of gravity. An eclipse of the sun
in 1919 brought proof that it was accurate. Einstein
had correctly calculated in advance the extent to
which the light from fixed stars would be deflected
through the sun’s gravitational field. The newspapers
proclaimed his work as “a scientific revolution.”
13.
Einstein received the Nobel Prize for Physics in
1921. He was showered with honours and invitations
from all over the world, and lauded by the press.

When the Nazis came to power in Germany in
1933, Einstein emigrated to the United States. Five
years later, the discovery of nuclear fission in Berlin
had American physicists in an uproar. Many of
them had fled from Fascism, just as Einstein had,
and now they were afraid the Nazis could build and
use an atomic bomb.

in an uproar: very
upset

A Truly Beautiful Mind / 49

At the urging of a colleague, Einstein wrote a
letter to the American President, Franklin D.
Roosevelt, on 2 August 1939, in which he warned:
“A single bomb of this type . . . exploded in a port,
might very well destroy the whole port together with
some of the surrounding territory.” His words did
not fail to have an effect. The Americans developed
the atomic bomb in a secret project of their own,
and dropped it on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki in August 1945.
16.
Einstein was deeply shaken by the extent of the
destruction. This time he wrote a public missive to
the United Nations. In it he proposed the formation
of a world government. Unlike the letter to Roosevelt,
this one made no impact. But over the next decade,
Einstein got ever more involved in politics —
agitating for an end to the arms buildup and using
his popularity to campaign for peace and democracy.
17.
When Einstein died in 1955 at the age of 76, he
was celebrated as a visionary and world citizen as
much as a scientific genius.

21 August 2005 — original handwritten manuscript of Albert Einstein
unearthed — by student Rowdy Boeynik in the University of the
Netherlands — Boeynik researching papers — papers belonging to an
old friend of Einstein — fingerprints of Einstein on these papers —
16-page document dated 1924 — Einstein’s work on this last theory —
behaviour of atoms at low temperature — now known as the Bose-Einstein
condensation — the manuscript to be kept at Leyden University where
Einstein got the Nobel Prize.

Dictation

Your teacher will dictate these paragraphs to you. Write down the paragraphs
with correct punctuation marks.
In 1931 Charlie Chaplin invited Albert Einstein, who was visiting Hollywood,
to a private screening of his new film, City Lights. As the two men drove into
town together, passersby waved and cheered. Chaplin turned to his guest and
explained: “The people are applauding you because none of them understands
you and applauding me because everybody understands me.”

One of Einstein’s colleagues asked him for his telephone number one
day. Einstein reached for a telephone directory and looked it up. “You don’t
remember your own number?” the man asked, startled.
“No,” Einstein answered. “Why should I memorise something I can so
easily get from a book?” (In fact, Einstein claimed never to memorise anything
which could be looked up in less than two minutes.)

And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;
There midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,
And evenings full of the linnet’s wings.
I will arise and go now, for always night and day
I hear the lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,
I hear it in the deep heart’s core.

kind of place is Innisfree? Think about:
the three things the poet wants to do when he goes back there (stanza I);
what he hears and sees there and its effect on him (stanza II);
what he hears in his “heart’s core” even when he is far away from
Innisfree (stanza III).

2. By now you may have concluded that Innisfree is a simple, natural place,
full of beauty and peace. How does the poet contrast it with where he now
stands? (Read stanza III.)
3. Do you think Innisfree is only a place, or a state of mind? Does the poet
actually miss the place of his boyhood days?
II. 1. Look at the words the poet uses to describe what he sees and hears at
