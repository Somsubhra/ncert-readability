Sing and enjoy this poem
Once I saw a little bird
Come hop, hop, hop,
I cried, “Little bird,
Will you stop, stop, stop?”

I was going to the window
To say, “How do you do?”
But he shook his little tail
And away he flew.

Mittu liked mangoes.
“I want to eat that yellow mango,”
he said.
He flew down to the tree.

“Caw, caw, go away.
This is my tree,” said a voice.
Mittu looked up.
He saw a big black crow.
“Caw, caw, go, go,”
the crow shouted.
He had a very loud voice.
Mittu was afraid of the crow.
He flew away.

Mittu saw a red balloon.
It was under a tree.
He had an idea.
He picked up the red balloon.
He was careful not to burst it.
He flew to the mango tree.
The crow was sitting on the tree.
Mittu went behind the tree.

He pecked the balloon with
his red beak.
“Pop!” The balloon burst.
It made a loud noise.

“Caw!” said the crow.
And he fell off the tree.
“Caw, caw, a big gun is after me,” said the crow.
He flew away.
He never came back to the tree.

Mittu came to the tree.
He ate the big yellow mango.
“Yummy yummy,
what a nice mango!” he said.
He was very happy.
Clever Mittu!

Teacher's Pages

The children look forward to this active approach of hearing, doing and
participating. Now they can be given the freedom to choose their groups and
tasks. Groups can be divided into those who want to (i) taste something
tangy like a lemon, (ii) sweet like sugar,
MATERIAL REQUIRED
(iii) bitter like neem/bitter gourd or (iv)
salt. Let them make nimbu pani with the
required ingredients and drink it.
2 lemons, a little sugar,
Shared activities will foster healthy
a little salt, neem leaves
relationships.
and drinking water.

By this time children should be able to read a few words. Involve them
in a reading activity, laying emphasis on the highlighted words in the text.
4
Develop pronunciation

Say aloud with the children
‘Stop’ says the red light,
‘Go’ says the green.
‘Wait’ says the yellow light,
Blinking in between.
4
Exposure to language

Display sight words in the classroom. Sight word vocabulary is
developed by using words repeatedly in meaningful contexts. Let children
read these:
chilli

mango

parrot

4
Develop speaking skills

o
n

1. The peacock is our national bird. The male bird has a beautiful tail.
The female is called a peahen. Encourage children to talk about
other birds they see in their school or near their homes.

2. Conversation based on ‘Role play’
l
At this

stage children should be able to identify different sounds
in their environment. Ask them to imagine that they are birds and
let them call out to another bird. Encourage them to listen to
sounds of nature (chirping of birds, rainfall, wind blowing etc.)

51

l
Act out a scene when the children are birds flying in the sky.
l
The children

may be taken out and given their food outdoors. Let
them be motivated to talk about different tastes after the meal or
have a conversation about nimbu pani if the activity has been
done.

4
Develop writing skills / fine motor coordination
1. Write the following words and numbers on the blackboard — hop,
stop, shop, mop and digits from 1 to 10. Use Activity Sheets and you
can also start using a notebook to further encourage the patterns as
on pages 43, 44, 48, 49 and 50.

d
e

2. Show the children how to draw a bird/ make a bird with clay/play
dough.
