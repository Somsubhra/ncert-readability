Unit 9

Sing a Song of People
Eveybody seems to be in such a hurry
these days! I wonder why?

Sing a song of people
Walking fast or slow;
People in the city,
Up and down they go.
People on the side walk,
People on the bus;
People passing, passing,
In back and front of us.
People on the subway
Underneath the ground;
People riding taxis
Round and round and round.
People with their hats on,
Going in the doors;
People with umbrellas
When it rains and pours.

148

People in tall buildings
And in stores below;
Riding elevators
Up and down they go.
People
People
People
People

walking singly,
in a crowd;
saying nothing,
talking loud.

People laughing, smiling,
Grumpy people too;
People who just hurry
And never look at you!
Sing a song of people
Who like to come and go;
Sing of city people
You see but never know!

Let's Listen
Read and listen to these two poems with your partner and
find out what are the things that the village child and the
city child like.

The Village Child

The City Child

I live in a city
My home is a house
In a street;
Near a wood
It is crowded with traffic
I'd live in a street
And feet;
If I could!
There are buses and motors
I do wish someone
And trams.
Lived near.
I wish there were meadows
There's no one to play with
And lambs.
At all.
The houses all wait
The trees are so high
In a row
And so tall:
There is smoke everywhere
That I go.
And I should be lonely
I don't like the noises
For hours,
I hear
Were it not for the birds
I wish there were woods
And the flowers.

Let's Talk
The people who live in cities often wish they could live in quiet
towns. Do you like the place you live in?
Tell your partner two things you like and don't like about
the place you live in.

Around the World
Which is the most interesting place you have visited?
How did you go there and return?
Have you travelled by different means of transport?
Is there a mode of transport that you would like
to use?

Mr Phileas Fogg lays a bet with some of his friends to go
around the world in 80 days. This is the story of how
he travelled with his companion, Passepartout.

154

Marigold

That evening they were on the train from San
Fransisco to New York, which was three
thousand seven hundred and eighty six miles
away. In seven days the train would take them
from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean.
The train steamed through California at
full speed. It crossed steep mountain slopes,
deep canyons and hair-raising curves moving
through a few tunnels and bridges.
Suddenly the train slowed down as a herd
of buffaloes charged across the railway track.
The train was forced to stop till the procession
passed like a great brown river. The herd took
a full three hours to cross the tracks. Night
had fallen by the time the train could move

155

again.
The train headed for the steep mountains. This was
the most difficult part of the journey with its winding
roads. They passed the highest point of their journey,
7524 feet above sea level. In a few hours they would be
out of the Rocky Mountains.
After the passengers had taken their breakfast the
train gave a shrill whistle and braked with a jerk and
came to a halt. Passepartout, a French passenger went to
see what the matter was. There was nothing to be seen.
The train had halted in the middle of nowhere. There was

156

Marigold

no station in sight.
He heard the signalman say, “The train can't go on.
The bridge near Medicine Bow won't support the weight.”
It was a suspension bridge and some of its cables were
broken.
The driver of the train said, “Perhaps there is a chance
of getting across the bridge by letting the train proceed at
maximum speed.”
“All aboard,” said the conductor. The passengers got
on the train and the driver reversed the train for nearly a
mile. Then he gave another whistle. The train began to
move forward so fast that it was frightening. The
passengers had the feeling that the train was not resting
on the tracks but was floating through air. As the engine
shrieked and the train shuddered they were over the
bridge in a flash!
As soon as they passed over the Medicine River, the
bridge crashed down into the raging waters below. The
train continued its course that evening without
interruption.
As the train moved forward the next day, it was
suddenly attacked by hundreds of Sioux Indians (a tribe
of native Red Indians). Many of them appeared from all
sides, jumped on to the moving train and pulled
themselves up the steps. They were armed with rifles.
Some of the travellers had revolvers. They defended

Marigold

157

themselves bravely by answering with pistol shots.
The conductor cried out, “The train must be stopped
or we are lost!” “I will go,” said Passepartout. He opened a
door and unseen by the Red Indians he slipped under the
racing train, and holding on to the chains he slowly
reached the engine. Then he separated the engine from
the coaches. They started to slow down.
They had neared a station where soldiers, attracted by
the sound of shots, hurried towards the train. The Red
Indians on board saw them and quickly jumped off before
the train stopped entirely.

Listen to the poem given below.
Day by Day I Float My Paper Boats
Day by day I float my paper boats
one by one down the running stream.
In big black letters I write my name on them
and the name of the village where I live.
I hope that someone in some strange

I load my little boats with shiuli flowers from our garden,
And hope that these blooms of the dawn will be carried safely
