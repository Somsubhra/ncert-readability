“In the class discussion Jane, you hardly said a word.
We all aired our opinions but from you we barely heard.
You sat and stared in silence surrounded by the chatter,
Now tell me Jane,
and please be plain,
is there anything the matter?”
Jane looked up and then she spoke,
Her voice was clear and low:
“There are many people in this world
Who are rather quiet you know!”

The Talkative Barber
Long long ago a Sultan, whose name was
Shahriar, ruled over a large kingdom. His
queen was a good storyteller. Each night she
would tell a story to the king. She narrated
ancient Persian and Arabic folk stories. This is
one of the stories, from the Arabian Nights.
Read this story about a man who cannot stop talking.

In the city of Cashgar, lived a barber who was a great
talker. Once the Sultan called the barber to shave
his head. The barber started talking non-stop
instead of shaving him. The Sultan got angry.
“When are you going to stop talking and begin to
do your work?”
The Barber replied, “You do me an injury by
calling me a chatterer. For, everyone says I am very
quiet. I have six brothers whom you might call
chatterers. Their names are Bacbone (buk-bon),
Bakbarea (buk-buria), Bakbac (buk-buk), Alcouz
(ul-kooz), Alnaschee (ul-nashi) and Schacabac( shaka-bak). One is humpbacked, one is toothless, one
is half blind, one is quite blind, one is deaf and the
other has a defect in his speech and they are all
great talkers, but I am the youngest of my family,

“Give him three pieces
of gold,” the Sultan cried,
losing all patience, “and send
him away. I will not be
shaved today.”
“My Master,” cried the
Barber, “it was not I who
came to seek you, it was
you who ordered me to
come. So I will not quit
your house till I have
shaved you.”
He then began narrating another
story, which lasted half an hour.
“Stop making your fine speeches and let me go
quickly. I have an affair of the greatest importance. I have
to go out at noon,” said the Sultan.

When he saw that the Sultan was really angry with
him, the Barber said, “O Master, do not be angry, I will
begin to shave you.” Saying this, he washed the Sultan’s
head and began to shave. But he had not touched him
even four times with the razor, when he stopped and
said, “My Master, you are acting hastily in this matter.”
“Go on shaving me, speak no more”, ordered the
Sultan.
“Be patient,” said the barber, “perhaps you have not
considered well what you were going to do. I wish you
would tell me what this matter of great importance is all
about and then I will give you my opinion on it.”
“Finish shaving at once,” the Sultan exclaimed. But,
instead of doing this, the Barber left the Sultan halfshaved to go and see what time it was.“ My patience is
exhausted,” the Sultan cried.
“Be calm, my Master and you shall be shaved in a
moment,” said the Barber and saying this, he continued
shaving the Sultan. But while he was doing this, he could
not help talking.
“If you could inform me what this important affair is, I
would give more advice, which you might find useful,” he
said.
The Sultan was completely fed up by now and decided
to satisfy the barber. He told him that he was giving a
feast to some friends at noon which was why he was in a
hurry to leave.
When the barber heard the Sultan mention a feast he
exclaimed, “That reminds me. Yesterday, I invited four or
five friends to come to my house today. But I had
quite forgotten it and have not made any

102

preparations for them.” The Sultan who was at the mercy
of the Barber, was ready to do anything to be rid of him.
“Be quick and finish your work,” the Sultan replied,
“and you shall have all the food that has been prepared
for me today.”
“Please show me the food so that I may judge if it is
enough for my five friends.”
“I have enough food for you!” the Sultan exclaimed.
But he ordered that all the food prepared for his feast be
brought in.
The Barber looked over the food and said “This is very
good but I shall want some fruit for the dessert also.”
The Sultan, in desperation, since his head was half
shaved, ordered that the fruits should also be brought in.

Teacher's Page

Poem: Class Discussion
Story: The Talkative Barber

THEMES
Humour
Awareness about different kinds of personalities — talkers, quiet people
and brave people
READING TIME
The use of a dictionary while doing all the vocabulary exercises should be encouraged
to help students gain confidence when they come across new, challenging words. The
teacher can ask the children to read stories from The Arabian Nights and other witty
and humorous stories, e.g. Tenali Raman, Akbar-Birbal etc.
CONVERSATION TIME
Ask the children to talk about wit and humour and understand their importance in
life. The teacher should explain that we must also learn to laugh at ourselves.
Some people talk too much and do not realise what they are saying while others do
not say a word. In both cases, the problem may be shyness. The teacher can help
children gain self-confidence by carrying out group activities like singing, dancing,
acting, sports, or a hobby like craft, painting etc. When the child discovers he is good
at something, it shall boost his self- confidence. Remember, every child has
something to say and has some insight to contribute to a class discussion. The
teacher needs to recognise this and help the children gain confidence, and teach
them to be courteous and civil.

WRITING TIME
Before starting on the writing exercise, the teacher could do a guided writing piece,
step-by-step, on the blackboard.
PROJECT WORK
What does being brave mean?
Telling the truth, not being tempted to do naughty things, not hiding things
from parents, being generous, all require children to be brave. Saving
someone's life, catching thieves etc. are brave deeds. Both, being brave and
doing brave deeds are creditable. It is not easy to be brave and children should
be encouraged to be brave and courageous.
The teacher can then discuss the Republic day parade, and the significance of
little children like them being given Bravery Awards.
