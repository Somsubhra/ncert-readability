4 The Rattrap
About the author
..
Selma Lagerlof (1858-1940) was a Swedish writer whose
stories have been translated into many languages. A
universal theme runs through all of them — a belief
that the essential goodness in a human being can be
awakened through understanding and love. This story
is set amidst the mines of Sweden, rich in iron ore,
which figure large in the history and legends of that
country. The story is told somewhat in the manner of a
fairy tale.

Once upon a time there was a man who went around selling
small rattraps of wire. He made them himself at odd
moments, from the material he got by begging in the stores
or at the big farms. But even so, the business was not
especially profitable, so he had to resort to both begging
and petty thievery to keep body and soul together. Even so,
his clothes were in rags, his cheeks were sunken, and
hunger gleamed in his eyes.
No one can imagine how sad and monotonous life can
appear to such a vagabond, who plods along the road, left
to his own meditations. But one day this man had fallen
into a line of thought, which really seemed to him
entertaining. He had naturally been thinking of his rattraps
when suddenly he was struck by the idea that the whole

world about him — the whole world with its lands and
seas, its cities and villages — was nothing but a big rattrap.
It had never existed for any other purpose than to set baits
for people. It offered riches and joys, shelter and food, heat
and clothing, exactly as the rattrap offered cheese and
pork, and as soon as anyone let himself be tempted to
touch the bait, it closed in on him, and then everything
came to an end.
The world had, of course, never been very kind to him,
so it gave him unwonted joy to think ill of it in this way. It
became a cherished pastime of his, during many dreary
ploddings, to think of people he knew who had let
themselves be caught in the dangerous snare, and of others
who were still circling around the bait.
One dark evening as he was trudging along the road
he caught sight of a little gray cottage by the roadside, and
he knocked on the door to ask shelter for the night. Nor
was he refused. Instead of the sour faces which ordinarily
met him, the owner, who was an old man without wife or
child, was happy to get someone to talk to in his loneliness.
Immediately he put the porridge pot on the fire and gave
him supper; then he carved off such a big slice from his
tobacco roll that it was enough both for the stranger’s pipe
and his own. Finally he got out an old pack of cards and

The old man was just as generous with his confidences
as with his porridge and tobacco. The guest was informed
at once that in his days of prosperity his host had been a

crofter at Ramsjo Ironworks and had worked on the land.
Now that he was no longer able to do day labour, it was his
cow which supported him. Yes, that bossy was
extraordinary. She could give milk for the creamery every
day, and last month he had received all of thirty kronor in
payment.
The stranger must have seemed incredulous, for the
old man got up and went to the window, took down a leather
pouch which hung on a nail in the very window frame, and
picked out three wrinkled ten-kronor bills. These he held
up before the eyes of his guest, nodding knowingly, and

pouch.

the door. He did not try to get in,
however. He only went up to the window, smashed a pane,
stuck in his hand, and got hold of the pouch with the
thirty kronor. He took the money and thrust it into his
own pocket. Then he hung the leather pouch very carefully
back in its place and went away.
As he walked along with the money in his pocket he
felt quite pleased with his smartness. He realised, of course,
that at first he dared not continue on the public highway,
but must turn off the road, into the woods. During the
first hours this caused him no difficulty. Later in the day
it became worse, for it was a big and confusing forest which
he had gotten into. He tried, to be sure, to walk in a definite
direction, but the paths twisted back and forth so strangely!
He walked and walked without coming to the end of the
wood, and finally he realised that he had only been walking
around in the same part of the forest. All at once he recalled
his thoughts about the world and the rattrap. Now his
own turn had come. He had let himself be fooled by a bait
and had been caught. The whole forest, with its trunks
and branches, its thickets and fallen logs, closed in upon
him like an impenetrable prison from which he could
never escape.

It was late in December. Darkness was already
descending over the forest. This increased the danger, and
increased also his gloom and despair. Finally he saw no
way out, and he sank down on the ground, tired to death,
thinking that his last moment had come. But just as he
laid his head on the ground, he heard a sound—a hard
regular thumping. There was no doubt as to what that
was. He raised himself. ‘‘Those are the hammer strokes
from an iron mill’’, he thought. ‘‘There must be people near
by’’. He summoned all his strength, got up, and staggered
in the direction of the sound.
..
The Ramsjo Ironworks, which are now closed down,
were, not so long ago, a large plant, with smelter, rolling
mill, and forge. In the summertime long lines of heavily
loaded barges and scows slid down the canal, which led to
a large inland lake, and in the wintertime the roads near
the mill were black from all the coal dust which sifted
down from the big charcoal crates.
During one of the long dark evenings just before
Christmas, the master smith and his helper sat in the
dark forge near the furnace waiting for the pig iron, which
had been put in the fire, to be ready to put on the anvil.
Every now and then one of them got up to stir the glowing
mass with a long iron bar, returning in a few moments,
dripping with perspiration, though, as was the custom, he
wore nothing but a long shirt and a pair of wooden shoes.
All the time there were many sounds to be heard in
the forge. The big bellows groaned and the burning coal
cracked. The fire boy shovelled charcoal into the maw of
the furnace with a great deal of clatter. Outside roared the
waterfall, and a sharp north wind whipped the rain against
the brick-tiled roof.
It was probably on account of all this noise that the
blacksmith did not notice that a man had opened the gate
and entered the forge, until he stood close up to the furnace.
Surely it was nothing unusual for poor vagabonds
without any better shelter for the night to be attracted to
the forge by the glow of light which escaped through the
sooty panes, and to come in to warm themselves in front of

the fire. The blacksmiths glanced only casually and
indifferently at the intruder. He looked the way people of
his type usually did, with a long beard, dirty, ragged, and
with a bunch of rattraps dangling on his chest.
He asked permission to stay, and the master blacksmith
nodded a haughty consent without honouring him with a
single word.
The tramp did not say anything, either. He had not
come there to talk but only to warm himself and sleep.
..
In those days the Ramsjo iron mill was owned by a
very prominent ironmaster, whose greatest ambition was
to ship out good iron to the market. He watched both night
and day to see that the work was done as well as possible,
and at this very moment he came into the forge on one of
his nightly rounds of inspection.
Naturally the first thing he saw was the tall ragamuffin
who had eased his way so close to the furnace that steam
rose from his wet rags. The ironmaster did not follow the
example of the blacksmiths, who had hardly deigned to
look at the stranger. He walked close up to him, looked
him over very carefully, then tore off his slouch hat to get
a better view of his face.
‘‘But of course it is you, Nils Olof!’’ he said. “How you
do look!”
The man with the rattraps had never before seen the
..
ironmaster at Ramsjo and did not even know what his
name was. But it occurred to him that if the fine gentleman
thought he was an old acquaintance, he might perhaps
throw him a couple of kronor. Therefore he did not want to
undeceive him all at once.
‘‘Yes, God knows things have gone downhill with me’’,
he said.
‘‘You should not have resigned from the regiment’’, said
the ironmaster. ‘‘That was the mistake. If only I had still
been in the service at the time, it never would have happened.
Well, now of course you will come home with me.’’
To go along up to the manor house and be received by
the owner like an old regimental comrade — that, however,
did not please the tramp.

‘‘No, I couldn’t think of it!’’ he said, looking quite
alarmed.
He thought of the thirty kronor. To go up to the manor
house would be like throwing himself voluntarily into the
lion’s den. He only wanted a chance to sleep here in the
forge and then sneak away as inconspicuously as possible.
The ironmaster assumed that he felt embarrassed
because of his miserable clothing.
‘‘Please don’t think that I have such a fine home that
you cannot show yourself there’’, He said... ‘‘Elizabeth is
dead, as you may already have heard. My boys are abroad,
and there is no one at home except my oldest daughter
and myself. We were just saying that it was too bad we
didn’t have any company for Christmas. Now come along
with me and help us make the Christmas food disappear a
little faster.”
But the stranger said no, and
no, and again no, and the ironmaster
saw that he must give in.

as he went away, and the blacksmith,
who knew him, understood very well
that he had not said his last word.
It was not more than half an hour before they heard
the sound of carriage wheels outside the forge, and a new
guest came in, but this time it was not the ironmaster. He
had sent his daughter, apparently hoping that she would
have better powers of persuasion than he himself.
She entered, followed by a valet, carrying on his arm a
big fur coat. She was not at all pretty, but seemed modest
and quite shy. In the forge everything was just as it had
been earlier in the evening. The master blacksmith and
his apprentice still sat on their bench, and iron and
charcoal still glowed in the furnace. The stranger had

stretched himself out on the floor and lay with a piece of
pig iron under his head and his hat pulled down over his
eyes. As soon as the young girl caught sight of him, she
went up and lifted his hat. The man was evidently used to
sleeping with one eye open. He jumped up abruptly and
seemed to be quite frightened.
‘‘My name is Edla Willmansson,’’ said the young girl.
‘‘My father came home and said that you wanted to sleep
here in the forge tonight, and then I asked permission to
come and bring you home to us. I am so sorry, Captain,
that you are having such a hard time.’’
She looked at him compassionately, with her heavy
eyes, and then she noticed that the man was afraid. ‘‘Either
he has stolen something or else he has escaped from, jail’’,
she thought, and added quickly, “You may be sure, Captain,
that you will be allowed to leave us just as freely as you
came. Only please stay with us over Christmas Eve.’’
She said this in such a friendly manner that the
rattrap peddler must have felt confidence in her.
‘‘It would never have occurred to me that you would
bother with me yourself, miss,’’ he said. ‘’I will come at
once.’’
He accepted the fur coat, which the valet handed him
with a deep bow, threw it over his rags, and followed the
young lady out to the carriage, without granting the
astonished blacksmiths so much as a glance.
But while he was riding up to the manor house he had
evil forebodings.
‘‘Why the devil did I take that fellow’s money?’’ he
thought. ‘‘Now I am sitting in the trap and will never get
out of it.’’
The next day was Christmas Eve, and when the
ironmaster came into the dining room for breakfast he
probably thought with satisfaction of his old regimental
comrade whom he had run across so unexpectedly.
“First of all we must see to it that he gets a little flesh
on his bones,” he said to his daughter, who was busy at
the table. “And then we must see that he gets something
else to do than to run around the country selling rattraps.”

“It is queer that things have gone downhill with him
as badly as that,” said the daughter. “Last night I did not
think there was anything about him to show that he had
once been an educated man.”
“You must have patience, my little girl,” said the father.
“As soon as he gets clean and dressed up, you will see
something different. Last night he was naturally
embarrassed. The tramp manners will fall away from him
with the tramp clothes.”
Just as he said this the door opened and the stranger
entered. Yes, now he was truly clean and well dressed.
The valet had bathed him, cut his hair, and shaved him.
Moreover he was dressed in a good-looking suit of clothes
which belonged to the ironmaster. He wore a white shirt
and a starched collar and whole shoes.
But although his guest was now so well groomed, the
ironmaster did not seem pleased. He looked at him with
puckered brow, and it was easy to understand that when
he had seen the strange fellow in the uncertain reflection
from the furnace he might have made a mistake, but that
now, when he stood there in broad daylight, it was
impossible to mistake him for an old acquaintance.
“What does this mean?” he thundered.
The stranger made no attempt to dissimulate. He saw
at once that the splendour had come to an end.
“It is not my fault, sir,” he said. “I never pretended to
be anything but a poor trader, and I pleaded and begged to
be allowed to stay in the forge. But no harm has been
done. At worst I can put on my rags again and go away”.
“Well,” said the ironmaster, hesitating a little, “it was
not quite honest, either. You must admit that, and I should
not be surprised if the sheriff would like to have something
to say in the matter.”
The tramp took a step forward and struck the table
with his fist.
“Now I am going to tell you, Mr Ironmaster, how things
are,” he said. “This whole world is nothing but a big rattrap.
All the good things that are offered to you are nothing but
cheese rinds and bits of pork, set out to drag a poor fellow

into trouble. And if the sheriff comes now and locks me up
for this, then you, Mr Ironmaster, must remember that a
day may come when you yourself may want to get a big
piece of pork, and then you will get caught in the trap.”
The ironmaster began to laugh.
“That was not so badly said, my good fellow. Perhaps
we should let the sheriff alone on Christmas Eve. But now
get out of here as fast as you can.”
But just as the man was opening the door, the daughter
said, “I think he ought to stay with us today. I don’t want
him to go.” And with that she went and closed the door.
“What in the world are you doing?” said the father.
The daughter stood there quite embarrassed and hardly
knew what to answer. That morning she had felt so happy
when she thought how homelike and Christmassy she was
going to make things for the poor hungry wretch. She could
not get away from the idea all at once, and that was why
she had interceded for the vagabond.
“I am thinking of this stranger here,” said the young
girl. “He walks and walks the whole year long, and there is
probably not a single place in the whole country where he
is welcome and can feel at home. Wherever he turns he is
chased away. Always he is afraid of being arrested and
cross-examined. I should like to have him enjoy a day of
peace with us here — just one in the whole year.”
The ironmaster mumbled something in his beard. He
could not bring himself to oppose her.
“It was all a mistake, of course,” she continued. “But
anyway I don’t think we ought to chase away a human
being whom we have asked to come here, and to whom we
have promised Christmas cheer.”
“You do preach worse than a parson,” said the
ironmaster. “I only hope you won’t have to regret this.”
The young girl took the stranger by the hand and led
him up to the table.
“Now sit down and eat,” she said, for she could see
that her father had given in.
The man with the rattraps said not a word; he only
sat down and helped himself to the food. Time after time

he looked at the young girl who had interceded for him.
Why had she done it? What could the crazy idea be?
..
After that, Christmas Eve at Ramsjo passed just as it
always had. The stranger did not cause any trouble because
he did nothing but sleep. The whole forenoon he lay on the
sofa in one of the guest rooms and slept at one stretch. At
noon they woke him up so that he could have his share of
the good Christmas fare, but after that he slept again. It
seemed as though for many years he had not been able to

sleep as quietly and safely as here at Ramsjo.
In the evening, when the Christmas tree was lighted,
they woke him up again, and he stood for a while in the
drawing room, blinking as though the candlelight hurt him,
but after that he disappeared again. Two hours later he
was aroused once more. He then had to go down into the
dining room and eat the Christmas fish and porridge.
As soon as they got up from the table he went around
to each one present and said thank you and good night,

dejectedly than usual. At church she had learned that one
of the old crofters of the ironworks had been robbed by a
man who went around selling rattraps.
“Yes, that was a fine fellow you let into the house,”
said her father. “I only wonder how many silver spoons are
left in the cupboard by this time.”
The wagon had hardly stopped at the front steps when
the ironmaster asked the valet whether the stranger was
still there. He added that he had heard at church that the
man was a thief. The valet answered that the fellow had
gone and that he had not taken anything with him at all.
On the contrary, he had left behind a little package which
Miss Willmansson was to be kind enough to accept as a
Christmas present.
The young girl opened the package, which was so badly
done up that the contents came into view at once. She
gave a little cry of joy. She found a small rattrap, and in it
lay three wrinkled ten kronor notes. But that was not all.
In the rattrap lay also a letter written in large, jagged
characters —
