The Lazy Frog
Unit 5
On a school day, you are busy studying, playing and chatting
with friends. When you have a holiday from school what do
you do? Would you behave a little like the frog in the
following poem?

78

Fred is a very lazy frog
Who lolls all day upon a log.
He always manages to shirk
Doing a single stroke of work.
His poor old mother calls in vain
“Come in and help!” he does not bother
To move two inches, much preferring
To be extremely hard-of-hearing.
He lies there in a silent heap,
And stays conveniently asleep.
If a lady frog hops past
You’d think he would get up at last
To bow, and help her on her way?
But no, I am ashamed to say
That when a lady frog comes by
He does not open up one eye!

Rip Van Winkle
This story is about Rip Van Winkle, a good-natured
but lazy man, who goes away into the hills and falls
asleep. When he awakens twenty years later, Rip finds
that quite a few things have changed!

Many years ago, at the foothills of the Kaatskill (Kat-skill)
mountains, was a little village. In the village lived a
simple, good-natured fellow named Rip Van Winkle. He
was a kind neighbour, ready to help anyone. Everyone in
the village liked him. The children of the village shouted
with joy whenever they saw him because he played with
them, he taught them to fly kites and shoot marbles, and
told them long stories.
The only problem with Rip was that he was very lazy.
He did no work on his own farm and just idled away his
time. His fences were falling to pieces. His cow was going
astray. Weeds grew on his farm. Rip's constant
companion was his dog, named Wolf. To avoid work, he
would walk away into the forest with his dog.
One day, Rip just walked on and on and reached the
highest part of the mountains. It was late in the
afternoon when he reached there. Tired after his long
climb, he lay down and began daydreaming. It was soon
evening and he realised it would be night by the time he

reached his village.
Suddenly, he heard a voice calling out, “Rip Van
Winkle, Rip Van Winkle!” He looked around and saw a
short, old man, with thick hair and a grizzled beard
walking towards him with a barrel. He made signs to help
him carry the barrel. Rip hurried
to help the stranger who caught
his hand tightly. Together they
reached a place where there
were some more odd looking
men, playing ninepins.
They were all dressed the
same way and all of them
had beards of various
shapes and colours. Even

84

though they were playing a game, their faces were
serious and there was silence! The only sound was the
noise of the balls, which echoed in the mountains like
thunder.
As Rip and his companion reached them, they
stopped playing and stared at Rip with a fixed gaze. Rip
was really frightened. His companion emptied the
contents of the barrel into glasses and made Rip drink it.
Rip obeyed as he was trembling with fear. Since he was
thirsty he drank a few more glasses and slowly fell into a
deep sleep.
On waking up, he found that he was at the place
where he had first met the old man. He rubbed his eyes —
it was a bright sunny morning. “Surely, I have not slept
here all night,” thought Rip.
He looked around for Wolf, but he was nowhere. Rip
whistled for him. “Wolf! Wolf!” he then shouted. No dog
was to be seen. “Where has this dog gone?” he
mut

85

tered to himself. He began to descend the mountain to go
back to his village.
As he neared the village, he met a number of people
but he didn't know any of them. The villagers also stared
at him equally surprised. “Who is this man?” said one.
“I've never seen him before,” said another, “look at his
long white beard and his wrinkled face.”
On hearing this, Rip stroked his chin and, to his
astonishment, he found his beard had grown a foot long,
and it was all white!
An old woman walked up to him and looked at his face
for a moment. Then she exclaimed — “It is Rip Van
Winkle! Welcome home again, old neighbour! Where have
you been these twenty long years?

Teacher's Page

Poem: The Lazy Frog
Story: Rip Van Winkle

THEMES
Value of time
Social behaviour
Discouraging laziness
Encouraging hard work
READING TIME
The meanings of the difficult words have to be explained alongside. The children
should also learn to use the dictionary on their own. Silent reading by the students
should be done before attempting the Let’s Read exercises. This will help them to
develop the reading skills of skimming and scanning.
CONVERSATION TIME
Each child should get a chance to be Rip's neighbour. Let them speak sentences that
are in the lesson. The children should also be encouraged to imagine what all had
happened in the twenty years that Rip was away. However, the teacher should see
that they don't commit factual errors that contradict the main storyline.
E.g. all those playing the part of the village children can have English names.
WRITING TIME
Many of the questions are open-ended and could have a variety of responses. This
should be encouraged. Some of the exercises in the unit are reflective and allow the
child to think about and understand his likes and dislikes.
PROJECT WORK
The meaning of the proverb ‘Time and tide wait for no man’ can make an
important contribution to the character-building of the children.
The importance of being on time must also be stressed upon and the children
should be asked to cite examples and situations from their own lives.
