Sport is an integral part of a healthy life. It is one way in
which we amuse ourselves, compete with each other and
stay fit. Among the various sports such as hockey, football
and tennis, cricket appears to be the most appealing
national entertainment today. How much do we really
know about the game called ‘cricket’?

ricket grew out of the many stick-andball games played in England 500 years
ago. The word ‘bat’ is an old English word that
simply means stick or club. By the seventeenth
century, cricket had evolved enough to be
recognisable as a distinct game. Till the middle of
the eighteenth century, bats were roughly the same
shape as hockey sticks, curving outwards at the
bottom. There was a simple reason for this: the ball
was bowled underarm, along the ground and the
curve at the end of the bat gave the batsman the
best chance of making contact.
One of the peculiarities of cricket is that a
Test match can go on for five days and still end

in a draw. No other modern team sport takes even
half as much time to complete. A football match
is generally over in an hour-and-a-half. Even
baseball completes nine innings in less than half
the time that it takes to play a limited-overs match,
the shortened version of modern cricket!
Another curious characteristic of cricket is that
the length of the pitch is specified—22 yards—
but the size or shape of the ground is not. Most
other team sports such as hockey and football
lay down the dimensions of the playing area.
Cricket does not. Grounds can be oval like the
Adelaide Oval or nearly circular, like Chepauk in
Chennai. A six at the Melbourne Cricket Ground
needs to clear much more ground than it does at
Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi.
There’s a historical reason behind both these
oddities. Cricket was the earliest modern team
sport to be codified. The first written ‘Laws of
Cricket’ were drawn up in 1744. They stated,
“the principals shall choose from amongst the
gentlemen present two umpires who shall
absolutely decide all disputes. The stumps must
be 22 inches high and the bail across them six
inches. The ball must be between five and six
ounces, and the two sets of stumps 22 yards

apart”. The world’s first cricket club was formed
in Hambledon in the1760s and the Marylebone
Cricket Club (MCC) was founded in 1787.
During the 1760s and 1770s it became common
to pitch the ball through the air rather than roll
it along the ground. This change gave bowlers
the options of length, deception through the air,
plus increased pace. It also opened new
possibilities for spin and swing. In response,
batsmen had to master timing and shot
selection. One immediate result was the
replacement of the curved bat with the straight
one. The weight of the ball was limited to between
5½ to 5½ ounces, and the width of the bat to
four inches. In 1774, the first leg-before law was
published. Also around this time, a third stump
became common. By 1780, three days had
become the length of a major match, and this
year also saw the creation of the first six-seam
cricket ball.

If you look at the game’s equipment, you can
see how cricket both changed with changing
times and yet fundamentally remained true to
its origins in rural England. Cricket’s most
important tools are all made of natural, preindustrial materials. The bat is made with
leather, twine and cork. Even today both bat
and ball are handmade, not industrially
manufactured. The material of the bat changed
slightly over time. Once it was cut out of a single
piece of wood. Now it consists of two pieces, the
blade which is made out of the wood of the willow
tree and the handle which is made out of cane
that became available as European colonialists
and trading companies established themselves
in Asia. Unlike golf and tennis, cricket has

refused to remake its tools with industrial or
man-made materials: plastic, fibreglass and
metal have been firmly rejected.
But in the matter of protective equipment,
cricket has been influenced by technological
change. The invention of vulcanised rubber led
to the introduction of pads in 1848 and
protective gloves soon afterwards, and the
modern game would be unimaginable without
helmets made out of metal and synthetic
lightweight materials.

The origins of Indian cricket are to be found in
Bombay and the first Indian community to start
playing the game was the small community of
Zoroastrians, the Parsis. Brought into close contact
with the British because of their interest in trade
and the first Indian community to westernise, the
Parsis founded the first Indian cricket club, the

Oriental Cricket Club, in Bombay in 1848. Parsi
clubs were funded and sponsored by Parsi
businessmen like the Tatas and the Wadias. The
white cricket elite in India offered no help to the
enthusiastic Parsis. In fact, there was a quarrel
between the Bombay Gymkhana, a whites-only
club, and Parsi cricketers over the use of a public
park. The Parsis complained that the park was
left unfit for cricket because the polo ponies of the
Bombay Gymkhana dug up the surface. When it
became clear that the colonial authorities were
prejudiced in favour of their white compatriots, the
Parsis built their own gymkhana to play cricket in.
The rivalry between the Parsis and the Bombay
Gymkhana had a happy ending for these pioneers
of Indian cricket. A Parsi team beat the Bombay
Gymkhana at cricket in 1889, just four years after

Test cricket from its origins in 1877 was
organised as a contest between different parts of
the British empire, not sovereign nations. The first
Test was played between England and Australia
when Australia was still a white-settler colony.
Similarly, the small countries of the Caribbean
that together make up the West Indies team
were British colonies till well after the Second
World War.

Television coverage changed cricket. It expanded
the audience for the game by beaming cricket into
small towns and villages. It also broadened
cricket’s social base. Children who had never
previously had the chance to watch international
cricket because they lived outside the big
cities, could now watch and learn by imitating
their heroes.

THE STORY

The technology of satellite television and the
world-wide reach of multi-national television
companies created a global market for cricket.
Matches in Sydney could now be watched live in
Surat. Since India had the largest viewership
for the game amongst the cricket-playing
nations and the largest market in the cricketing
world, the game’s centre of gravity shifted to
South Asia. This shift was symbolised by the
shifting of the ICC headquarters from London to
tax-free Dubai.
One hundred and fifty years ago the first Indian
cricketers, the Parsis, had to struggle to find an
open space to play in. Today, the global
marketplace has made Indian players the
best-paid, most famous cricketers in the game, men
for whom the world is a stage. This transformation
was made up of many smaller changes: the
replacement of the gentlemanly amateur by the
paid professional, the triumph of the one-day game
as it overshadowed Test cricket in terms of
popularity, and the remarkable changes in global
commerce and technology.

According to some botanists, plants are able
to sense the vibrations of music through their
stomata. How this occurs is not yet known.
Yields of some crops are reported to have
increased substantially when the plants
were exposed to music. Many plant lovers,
including Prince Charles of Britain, believe that
talking to plants makes them grow better.
