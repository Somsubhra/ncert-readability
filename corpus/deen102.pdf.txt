Noses
I looked in the mirror
and looked at my nose:
it’s the funniest thing,
the way it grows
stuck right out where all of it shows
with two little holes where the
breathing goes.

I looked in the mirror
and saw in there
the end of my chin
and the start of my hair
and between there
isn’t much space to spare with my nose,
like a handle, sticking there.

If ever you want
to giggle and shout
and can’t think of what
to do it about,
just look in the mirror and then, no doubt,
you’ll see how funny YOUR nose
sticks out!

The Little Fir Tree
Shetty the magician was
returning home, when
all of a sudden it
began to rain. It
rained heavily. Shetty
looked around for
shelter and saw a pretty
little fir tree. He ran
towards it as fast as he
could.
Soon the rain
stopped. Shetty was
happy, that he did
not get wet.
“Thank you,
you have been
kind to me. I would
like to reward you.
Ask for four wishes
and I will grant
them,” said the
magician.

The sad fir tree had leaves like
needles and no birds ever made
their nests on it. So it said, “I
wish I had green leaves like
my other friends.”
Next morning, its wish was
granted. Soon a goat came
along and ate all the green
leaves. “Oh! dear,” said the fir
tree. “I wish I had gold leaves as
goats do not eat gold leaves.”
When the little fir tree woke up the next
morning it was surprised to see gold leaves.
“How happy I am!” it said.
A man came along and stole the
gold leaves.
“I wish I had glass
leaves instead. Men do
not steal glass leaves.”
The next day its
glass leaves shone in
the bright sun. “How
happy I am!” it said.
At night the wind
blew whoo...oo...oo. All
the glass leaves broke.

Ajit loved flowers. He
always wanted to have
a garden for himself.
Mohan, his friend gave
him an idea. He said,
“Why, we can have a
garden in a dish!”
“Ha! Ha!” Ajit laughed. “A garden in a dish?”
“Yes, dish gardens are tiny gardens planted in a shallow dish.
We must first put sand, manure and pebbles in a dish. Plant
very tiny plants in it and place the dish on the window sill.”

THEMES
Self-esteem and satisfaction
Respecting individuality

Teacher's pages

Poem : Noses
Story: The Little Fir Tree

The main aim of this Unit is to sensitise the child and make her/him feel
happy with what she/he is or has. These expressions of inner feelings are not
to be judged/labelled but may only be heard, seen and shared by you.
Give the children practice in observation and conversation. Let them talk
freely about different type of faces and noses that they have seen. Bring the
shy child into conversation while asking questions. Talk with them about the
way they use their eyes, ears, nose and minds.

How do we behave and see ourselves and how do others see us? Do they see
us as kind, helpful or funny? Stress the three sides of a person. The one you
think you are, the one others think you are, the one you really are.
Warm up

If you have a child in your class who you feel is not very confident, invite the
little one to sit comfortably and then involve four/five children to share
something they like about her/him as a friend. With exchanges and sharing
in this way, you will very soon have a class where children relate to each
other and participate in learning.
Avoid correcting them when they are speaking. The idea is to build
confidence, and finally, fluency in speaking.
Reading time

Step 1 : Read the text aloud with voice modulation.

Step 2 : Let the children read the text along with you.

Develop the child’s self-esteem and cultivate children’s creativity. In the
context of a fast changing world it is imperative that we respect the
children’s wisdom and imagination.

In this Unit involve children with ‘a creative time’ activity, for example, let
them share with you their interest in speaking, writing, drawing (any other
art form or paper activity). They can be encouraged to use this medium to
express “Who am I? What do I want to be?” The activity helps the children to
express their thoughts logically. They also learn to interact with each other.

35

d
e

Divide the class into conversation groups, help each child to make and
think what he saw that morning – his father, baby sister, pet, etc. and ask
them how they feel. They can illustrate this through pictures which can be
displayed in the class.
Writing time
Help children improve their handwriting with practise but guide them by
precept and discussion.
Handwriting suggestions can be put up on a chart for the class. Some of
these can be to –

d
e

(a) make the writing even.
(b) begin sentences with capital letters.
(c) end the sentences with periods or question marks.

Creative time
l
Ensure

that the children’s running handwriting is done in their
notebooks.

l
From the spellings that they have learnt from this lesson let them construct

meaningful sentences in their notebooks.
l
Try to

teach organisational skills. Let children make a poem on their
eyes/ears, or on the peacock, our national bird, in their notebooks.

l
Introduce

the use of ‘and’ and ‘but’ through oral work to bring out the
function of addition and contrast respectively.

Language corner : Let children be given sentences using is/are.
Environment

Segregation of class waste-paper, food articles, into containers of
biodegradable and degradable waste can be started in a simple, efficient
and environmental friendly manner.
