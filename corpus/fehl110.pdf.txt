Have you seen a mongoose? You have read in

The fight of the cobra and the
mongoose is a classic drama often
seen in India, and the outcome is
largely the same. The mongoose is
not immune to the venomous bite,
but is faster and quicker in motion
than the snake. The cobra assumes
a posture of defence and attempts to
reach the animal by a sweeping
strike, but the quick-moving
mongoose jumps out of reach and
comes at the snake from another

o
n

direction, before the snake can
get into striking position again.
This constant movement tires and
discourages the snake, and the
mongoose is finally able to leap in
close and bury its teeth in the
snake’s neck, usually severing the
joints of its vertebrae.

THE BANYAN TREE

125

You must have seen a banyan tree. This is a
story about what the author saw, as a young
boy, when he was sitting in an old banyan tree
in his grandfather’s house.

Part I
1. THOUGH the house and grounds belonged
to my grandparents, the magnificent old
banyan tree was mine — chiefly because
Grandfather, at sixty-five, could no
longer climb it.
2.
Its spreading branches, which hung
to the ground and took root again,
forming a number of twisting passages,
gave me endless pleasure. Among them
were squirrels and snails and
butterflies. The tree was older than the
house, older than Grandfather, as old
as Dehra Dun itself. I could hide myself
in its branches, behind thick green
leaves, and spy on the world below.
3.
My first friend was a small grey
squirrel. Arching his back and sniffing
into the air, he seemed at first to resent
my invasion of his privacy. But when
he found that I did not arm myself with
catapult or air gun, he became friendly,
and when I started bringing him pieces
of cake and biscuit he grew quite bold
and was soon taking morsels from hand.
Before long, he was delving into my
pockets and helping himself to whatever
he could find. He was a very young
squirrel, and his friends and relatives

probably thought him foolish and
headstrong for trusting a human.
4.
In the spring, when the banyan tree
was full of small red figs, birds of all
kinds would flock into its branches: the
red- bottomed bulbul, cheerful and
greedy; parrots, myna and crows
squabbling with one another. During the
fig season, the banyan tree was the
noisiest place in the garden.
5.
Halfway up the tree I had built a
crude platform where I would spend the
afternoons when it was not too hot. I
could read there propping myself up
against the tree with a cushion from the
living room. Treasure Island, Huckleberry
Finn and The Story of Dr Dolittle were

o
n

during the fig
season: the time
when figs appeared

propping myself up:
leaning against

THE BANYAN TREE

127

some of the books that made up my
banyan tree library.
6.
When I did not feel like reading, I
could look down through the leaves at
the world below. And on one particular
afternoon I had a grandstand view of
that classic of the Indian wilds, a fight
between a mongoose and a cobra.

7. The warm breezes of approaching
summer had sent everyone, including
the gardener, into the house. I was
feeling drowsy myself, wondering if I
should go to the pond and have a swim
with Ramu and the buffaloes, when I
saw a huge black cobra gliding out of a
clump of cactus. At the same time a
mongoose emerged from the bushes and
went straight for the cobra.
8.
In a clearing beneath the banyan
tree, in bright sunshine, they came
face to face. The cobra knew only too
well that the grey mongoose, three
feet long, was a superb fighter, clever
and aggressive. But the cobra, too,
was a skilful and experienced fighter.
He could move swiftly and strike with
the speed of light; and the sacs
behind his long sharp fangs were full
of deadly poison. It was to be a battle
of champions.

9.

Hissing defiance, his forked tongue
darting in and out, the cobra raised
three of his six feet off the ground, and
spread his broad, spectacled hood. The
mongoose bushed his tail. The long hair
on his spine stood up.
10.
Though the combatants were
unaware of my presence in the tree, they
were soon made aware of the arrival of
two other spectators. One was a myna,
the other a jungle crow. They had seen
these preparations for battle, and had
settled on the cactus to watch the
outcome. Had they been content only
to watch, all would have been well with
both of them.

THE BANYAN TREE

The cobra stood on the defensive,
swaying slowly from side to side, trying
to mesmerise the mongoose into making
a false move. But the mongoose knew
the power of his opponent’s glassy,
unwinking eyes, and refused to meet
them. Instead he fixed his gaze at a point
just below the cobra’s hood, and opened
the attack.
12.
Moving forward quickly until he was
just within the cobra’s reach, the
mongoose made a pretended move to
one side. Immediately the cobra struck.
His great hood came down so swiftly
that I thought nothing could save the
mongoose. But the little fellow jumped
neatly to one side, and darted in as
swiftly as the cobra, biting the snake
on the back and darting away again
out of reach.
13.
At the same moment that the cobra
struck, the crow and the myna hurled
themselves at him, only to collide heavily
in mid-air. Shrieking insults at each
other they returned to the cactus plant.
A few drops of blood glistened on the
cobra’s back.
14.
The cobra struck and missed. Again
the mongoose sprang aside, jumped in
and bit. Again the birds dived at the
snake, bumped into each other instead,
and returned shrieking to the safety of
the cactus.

The third round followed the same
course as the first but with one dramatic
difference. The crow and the myna, still
deter mined to take part in the
proceedings, dived at the cobra; but this
time they missed each other as well as
their mark. The myna flew on and
reached its perch, but the crow tried to
pull up in mid-air and turn back. In the
second that it took the bird to do this
the cobra whipped his head back and
struck with great force, his snout
thudding against the crow’s body.
16.
I saw the bird flung nearly twenty feet
across the garden. It fluttered about for
a while, then lay still. The myna
remained on the cactus plant, and when

the snake and the mongoose returned
to the fight, very wisely decided not to
inter fere again! The cobra was
weakening, and the mongoose, walking
fearlessly up to it, raised himself on his
short legs and with a lightning snap had
the big snake by the snout. The cobra
writhed and lashed about in a
frightening manner, and even coiled
itself about the mongoose, but to no
avail. The little fellow hung grimly on,
until the snake had ceased to struggle.
He then smelt along its quivering length,
gripped it round the hood, and dragged
it into the bushes.
17.
The myna dropped cautiously to
the ground, hopped about, peered
into the bushes from a safe distance,
and then, with a shrill cry of
congratulation, flew away.
