The National Curriculum Framework, 2005,
recommends that children's life at school must be
linked to their life outside the school. This principle
marks a departure from the legacy of bookish
learning which continues to shape our system and
causes a gap between the school, home and
community. The syllabi and textbooks developed
on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement
this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote
learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries
between different subject areas. We hope these
measures will take us significantly further in the
direction of a child-centred system of education
outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps
that school principals and teachers will take to
encourage children to reflect on their own learning
and to pursue imaginative activities and questions.
We must recognise that, given space, time and
freedom, children generate new knowledge by
engaging with the information passed on to them by
adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole
basis of examination is one of the key reasons why
other resources and sites of learning are ignored.
Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we
perceive and treat children as participants in learning,
not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school
routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the
daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in
implementing the annual calendar so that the
required number of teaching days are actually
devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching
and evaluation will also determine how effective this
textbook proves for making children's life at school
a happy experience, rather than a source of stress
or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to
address the problem of curricular burden by

restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different
stages with greater consideration for child
psychology and the time available for teaching. The
Supplementary Reader attempts to enhance this
endeavour by giving higher priority and space to
opportunities for contemplation and wondering,
discussion in small groups, and activities requiring
hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research
and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work
done by the Textbook Development Committee
responsible for this book. We wish to thank the
Chairperson of the Advisory Committee in Languages,
Professor Namwar Singh and the Chief Advisor for
this book, Professor Amritavalli for guiding the work
of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the
development of this Supplementary Reader; we are
grateful to their principals for making this possible.
We are indebted to the institutions and
organisations which have generously permitted us
to draw upon their resources, material and
personnel. We are especially grateful to the members
of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed
by the Department of Secondary and Higher
Education, Ministry of Human Resource
Development under the Chairmanship of Professor
Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their
valuable time and contribution. As an organisation
committed to systemic reform and continuous
improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT
welcomes comments and suggestions which will
enable us to undertake further revision and
refinement.

Vistas is a supplementary reader in English
(Core course) for Class XII, based on the guidelines
of the National Curriculum Framework 2005. The
main objective of this book is to make extensive
reading an enjoyable experience, lead students to
appreciate some of the best examples of writing and
understand the social milieu they live in.
An attempt has been made to attain these
objectives by presenting varied themes and genres
of writing. The themes range from scientific fantasy,
political satire, and adventure, to ethical and moral
issues and personal conflicts.
Jack Finney’s ‘The Third Level’ is a scientific
fantasy, while ‘The Tiger King’ by Kalki is a political
satire. ‘Antartica’ is a travel piece, with a suggestion
that the young reader could take part in the
expedition by logging on to www.studentsonice.com.
The three stories that follow are by Pearl S. Buck,
John Updike and Colin Dexter. Buck’s story sets
human fellow-feeling against national loyalty; John
Updike’s story is about a child participating in the
construction of a story by her father and raises
issues regarding parental prejudices foisted on
children. Dexter’s story is fun-reading about how a
criminal escapes jail through creating circumstances
by insisting on taking an examination in the prison.
The play by Susan Hill is on the themes of
disabilities while excerpts from Bama’s ‘Karukku’
and an excerpt from ‘The Land of the Red Apple’, a
story in Zitkala-Sa’s, book ‘The School Days of an
What will now

Gandhiji’s Talisman

no

tt

I will give you a talisman. Whenever
you are in doubt or when the self
becomes too much with you, apply
the following test:
Recall the face of the poorest and
the weakest man whom you may
have seen and ask yourself if the
step you contemplate is going to be
of any use to him. Will he gain
anything by it? Will it restore him
to a control over his own life and
destiny? In other words, will it lead
to Swaraj for the hungry and
spiritually starving millions?
Then you will find your doubts
and your self melting away.
