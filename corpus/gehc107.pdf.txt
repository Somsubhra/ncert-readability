The Invention of
Vita-Wonk

Mr Willy Wonka begins by inventing WonkaVite, which makes people younger. But WonkaVite is too strong. So some people disappear,
because their age becomes Minus! One person
actually becomes minus eighty-seven, which
means he’s got to wait eighty-seven years
before he can come back.
Mr Willy Wonka must invent a new thing...

“A tree,” Charlie said.
“Right you are, Charlie! But what kind of a
tree? Not the Douglas fir. Not the oak. Not the
cedar. No, no, my boy. It is a tree called the
Bristlecone pine that grows upon the slopes of
Wheeler Peak in Nevada, U.S.A. You can find
Bristlecone Pines on Wheeler Peak today that
are over 4000 years old! This is fact, Charlie. Ask
any dendrochronologist you like (and look that
word up in the dictionary when you get home,
will you please?). So that started me off. I
jumped into the Great Glass Elevator and
rushed all over the world collecting special items
from the oldest living things...

“All over the world, Charlie,” Mr Wonka went on
“I tracked down very old and ancient animals and
took an important little bit of something from each
one of them — a hair or an eyebrow or sometimes
it was no more than an ounce or two of the jam
scraped from between its toes while it was
sleeping. I tracked down THE WHISTLE-PIG, THE
BOBOLINK, THE SKROCK, THE POLLYFROG, THE
GIANT CURLICUE, THE STINGING SLUG AND THE

my Inventing Room, I produced one tiny cupful of
oily black liquid and gave four drops of it to a
brave twenty-year-old Oompa-Loompa volunteer
to see what happened.”
“What did happen?” Charlie asked.
“It was fantastic!” cried Mr Wonka. “The
moment he swallowed it, he began wrinkling and
shrivelling up all over and his hair started
dropping off and his teeth started falling out and,
before I knew it, he had suddenly become an old
fellow of seventy-five! And thus, my dear Charlie,
was Vita-Wonk invented!”

Writing
1.

(i) Make a list of the trees Mr Wonka mentions. Where
do these trees grow? Try to find out from an
encyclopaedia. Write a short paragraph about two or
three of these trees.
(ii) Name some large trees commonly found in your area.
Find out something about them (How old are they?
Who planted them? Do birds eat their fruit?), and
write two or three sentences about each one of them.
2. Find out something interesting about age, or growing old,
and write a paragraph about it. Following are a few topics,
suggested as examples.
• The age profile of a country’s population — does it have
more young people than old people, or vice versa? What
are the consequences of this?
• How can we tell how old a tree, a horse, or a rock is?
• What is the ‘life expectancy’ of various living things,
and various populations (how long can they reasonably
expect to live)?

Delivery Delayed
When the postman arrived at the Roy
household to deliver the mail, he was surprised
to find a new vicious dog. The dog was fastened
to a tree by a leash just long enough to reach
the front door. The dog growled and bared its
teeth. But the postman managed to outwit the
dog and reach the front door safely. How?

Dad and the Cat
and the Tree
Have you ever seen a cat climbing a tree? Sometimes
a cat may climb too high and get stuck in the tree.
The poor thing can’t come down without help. How
would you help it? Surely, not like Dad in the poem.
Is Dad a good climber? What were his plans? Read
the poem to find out.

This morning a cat got
Stuck in our tree.
Dad said, “Right, just
Leave it to me.”

The tree was wobbly,
The tree was tall.
Mum said, “For goodness’
Sake don’t fall!”
“Fall?” scoffed Dad,
“A climber like me?
Child’s play, this is!
You wait and see.”

He got out the ladder
From the garden shed.
It slipped. He landed
In the flower bed.

Brushing the dirt
Off his hair and his face
And his trousers and his shirt,

“We’ll try Plan B. Stand

Mum said, “Don’t fall
Again, O.K.?”

On a branch. It broke.

Then he climbed up high
On the garden wall.
Guess what?
He didn’t fall!

He gave a great leap
And he landed flat
In the crook of the tree-trunk —
Right on the cat!
The cat gave a yell
And sprang to the ground,
Pleased as Punch to be
Safe and sound.

So it’s smiling and smirking,
