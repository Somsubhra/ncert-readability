Learn and enjoy this poem
I often sit and wish that I
Could be a kite up in the sky,
And ride upon the breeze and go
Whichever way I chanced to blow.

Sundari
Read and enjoy this story
Sundari was a big red,
white and blue kite.
When Bobby made her
she smiled at him.
“You are beautiful and I
will call you Sundari,” he
said.
One day, Bobby took
Sundari to the fair.
The band was playing and everyone was smiling.
A merry-go-round was playing a happy little tune. It
was carrying lots of boys and girls round and round on
its wooden animals.
Bobby looked for an open space where he could run
and fly his kite. Sundari looked too.
Out in the grass ran Bobby, holding up his kite as high
as he could.
Puff! The wind
came along.
Sundari started
to fly up! But she
could not go very
high. A little dog
was holding on
to her long tail.
It was in his

mouth.
Bobby shooed the dog away.
“We’ll try again,” Bobby said.
This time Sundari leaped up in the air. She tugged
hard. Oh, how she wanted Bobby to let go of her string!
She gave a big tug. Bobby had to let her go.
“Wheee!” cried Sundari. “Now I can fly as high as I
please!”

In this unit we introduce children to sounds like blow, whoosh, puff, whiff,
dizzy, shooed, shoo, woof, and woo. Encourage children to listen to all the
sounds on their way to school. Let them discuss the ones that were pleasant
and those that were not. You can also ask them to recite different rhymes
involving animal sounds.

Exposure to language

Continue to use sight words in the classroom. Here you can put up the
following words and get the children to repeat after you.
door

tree

window

Develop speaking skills

Divide your class into four groups: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4
Enjoy this short play with children saying:
All children

:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Group-1

:

Whoosh! Whoosh! Once I caught a fish alive.

Group-2

:

6, 7, 8, 9, 10

Woof! Woof! Then I let it go again.

Group-3

:

11, 12, 13, 14, 15

Shoo! Shoo! Why did you let it go?

Group-4

o
n

:

16, 17, 18, 19, 20

Blow! Blow! Because it bit my finger so.

Group-1, 2, 3 :

Which finger did it bite?

Group-4

This little finger on my right.

:

Let all children clap their hands and say this entire rhyme once again.

Through play, children develop the habit of establishing and following
instructions which will help them throughout their lives. Playing in
groups helps them to exercise self control. It also gives an opportunity to
the teacher to observe and improve children’s social understanding and
attitudes.

Develop writing skills / fine motor coordination
Introduce A to Z in capital letters. Write from a to z on the blackboard.
Let the children write and read from the board and from the picture
dictionary. Use Activity Sheets and a notebook for further practice.
Let children move in a single line saying, “Puff, puff goes the train”.
4
Raising awareness
Involve the children in a kite making
activity. They can either decorate their
class or the trees outside with the
kites they have made. They can talk
about festivals when kites fly in the
sky.
