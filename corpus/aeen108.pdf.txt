A tiger was dozing under a tree. A mosquito came
buzzing by. The tiger said, “Hey! Mosquito!
Go away!”
The mosquito said,
“Why should I go
away? I am not afraid
of you!”
The tiger was angry.
He hit out with his
paw.

The mosquito flew off. The paw struck his own cheek.
The blow scraped his cheek. It began to bleed.
The mosquito buzzed away.
The tiger struck with his
other paw. The mosquito
flew off. This time, too,
he hit himself.
The tiger was
helpless. The mosquito
continued to buzz.
The tiger got up and
quietly walked away.
The mosquito called out
after him, “Don’t be so proud, my friend. Everyone is
great in his own way!”
