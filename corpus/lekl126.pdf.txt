Isaac Asimov was a Russian born American author
and biochemist. He was a highly successful and

Isaac Asimov
1920-1992

exceptionally prolific writer best known for his
works on science fiction and for his popular
science books.
Most of Asimov’s popularised science books
explain science concepts in a historical way,
going back as far as possible to a time when
the science in question was at its simplest
stage. He also lent his name to the magazine,
Asimov’s Science Fiction.

I
The Prescientific Universe
Foreword

To every history there is a prehistoric period. In the
case of science fiction, the prehistory lingers on even
today in some of the aspects of the field.

o
n

d
e

But what of that? Just as Ice Age art can hold up its
head with any form of art produced by sophisticated
modern man, so can the prehistoric aspects of
science fiction prove an accomplished literary form.

I have often made the point that true science fiction is a
creature of the last two centuries. Science fiction cannot
exist as a picture of the future unless, and until, people
get the idea that it is science and technology that produce
the future; that it is advances in science and technology

192/K ALEIDOSCOPE

(or, at the very least, changes in them) that are bound to
make the future different from the present and the past,
and that thereby hangs a tale.
Naturally, no one could possibly get that idea until
the rate of scientific and technological change became great
enough to be noticed by people in the course of their
lifetime. That came about with the Industrial Revolution
say, by 1800—and it was only thereafter that science fiction
could be written.
And yet there must have been something that came
before science fiction, something that was not science fiction
and yet filled the same emotional needs. There must have
been tales of the strange and different, of life not as we
know it, and of powers transcending our own.
Let’s consider—
The respect that people have for science and for
scientists (or the fear that people have or a combination of
both) rests on the certain belief that science is the key to
the understanding of the Universe and that scientists can
use science to manipulate that key. Through science, people
can make use of the laws of nature to control the
environment and enhance human powers. By the steadily
increasing understanding of the details of those laws,
human powers will be greater in the future than in the
past. If we can imagine the different ways in which they
will be greater, we can write our stories.
In previous centuries, however, most men had but a
dim understanding, if any at all, of such things as laws of
nature. They did not know of rules that were unbreakable;
of things-as-they-must-be that could serve neither to help
us nor to thwart us but that might allow themselves to be
ridden to glory, if we but knew how.
Instead, there was the notion that the Universe was
the plaything of life and the will; that if there were events
that seemed analogous to human deeds but that were far
greater in magnitude, they were carried through by lifeform’s resembling those we know but greater in size and
power.

193/ON SCIENCE FICTION

The beings who controlled natural phenomena were
therefore pictured in human form, but of superhuman
strength, size, abilities, and length of life. Sometimes they
were pictured as superanimal, or as supercombinations of
animals. (The constant reference to the ordinary in the
invention of the unusual is only to be expected, for
imaginations are sharply limited, even among the best of
us, and it is hard to think of anything really new or
unusual—as Hollywood ‘Sci-fi’ constantly demonstrates.)
Since the phenomena of the Universe don’t often make
sense, the gods are usually pictured as whimsical and
unpredictable; frequently little better than childish. Since
natural events are often disastrous, the gods must be easily
offended. Since natural events are often helpful, the gods
are basically kindly, provided they are well-treated and
that their anger is not roused.
It is only too reasonable to suppose that people would
invent formulas for placating the gods and persuading them
to do the right thing. Nor can the validity of these formulas
be generally disproven by events. If the formulas don’t work,
then undoubtedly someone has done something to offend
the gods. Those who had invented or utilised the formulas
had no problems in finding guilty parties on whom to blame
the failure of the formula in specific instances, so that
faith in the formulas themselves never wavered. (We needn’t
sneer. By the same principle, we continue to have faith in
economists, sociologists, and meteorologists today, even
though their statements seem to match reality only
erratically at best.)
In prescientific times, then, it was the priest,
magician, wizard, shaman (again the name doesn’t matter)
who filled the function of the scientist today. It was the
priest, etc., who was perceived as having the secret of
controlling the Universe, and it was advances in the
knowledge of magical formulas that could enhance power.
The ancient myths and legends are full of stories of
human beings with supernormal powers. There are the
legendary heroes, for instance, who learn to control winged
horses or flying carpets. Those ancient pieces of magic

still fascinate us today, and I imagine a youngster could
thrill to such mystical methods of aeronavigation and long
for the chance to partake in it, even if he were reading the
tales while on a jet plane.
Think of the crystal ball, into which one can see things
that are happening many miles away, and magic shells
that can allow us to hear the whisperings of humans many
miles away. How much more wonderful than the television
sets and the telephones of today!
Consider the doors that open with ‘Open sesame’ rather
than by the click of a remote-control device. Consider the
seven-league boots that can transport you across the
countryside almost as quickly as an automobile can.
Or, for that matter, think of the monsters of legend,
the powerful travesties of life invented by combining animal
characteristics: the man-horse Centaur, the man-goat
Satyr, the woman-lion Sphinx, the woman-hawk Harpy,
the eagle-lion Gryphon, the snake-woman Gorgon, and so
on. In science fiction we have extraterrestrials that are
often built up on the same principle.
The goals of these ancient stories are the same as
those of modern science fiction—the depiction of life as we
don’t know it.
The emotional needs that are fulfilled are the same—
the satisfaction of the longing for wonder.
The difference is that the ancient myths and legends
fulfil those needs and meet those goals against the
background of a Universe that is controlled by gods and
demons who can, in turn, be controlled by magical formulas
either in the form of enchantments to coerce, or prayers to
cajole. Science fiction, on the other hand, fulfils those needs
against the background of a Universe that is controlled by
impersonal and unswervable laws of nature, which can,
in turn, be controlled by an understanding of their nature.
In a narrow sense, only science fiction is valid for
today since, as far as we can tell, the Universe does follow
the dictates of the laws of nature and is not at the mercy of
gods and demons.

Nevertheless, there are times when we shouldn’t be
two narrow or haughty in our definitions. It would be wrong
to throw out a style of literature that has tickled the human
fancy for thousands of years for the trivial reason that it is
not in accord with reality. Reality isn’t all there is, after all.
Shall we no longer thrill to the climactic duel of Achilles
and Hector because people no longer fight with spears and
shields? Shall we no longer feel the excitement of the naval
battles of the War of 1812 and of the Napoleonic Wars
because our warships are no longer made of wood and are
no longer equipped with sails?
Never!
Why, then, shouldn’t people who enjoy an exciting
science fiction adventure story not enjoy a rousing
mythological fiction adventure story? The two are set in
different kinds of Universes but follow analogous paths.
So though I am sufficiently stick-in-the-muddish to be
narrow in my definition of science fiction and would not be
willing to consider sword-and-sorcery examples of science
fiction, I am willing to consider it the equivalent of science
fiction set in another kind of Universe—a prescientific
Universe.
I don’t even ask that they be wrenched out of context
and somehow be made to fit the universe of reality by being
given a scientific or pseudoscientific gloss. I ask only that
they be self-consistent in their prescientific Universe—
and that they be well-written and exciting stories.

II
The Universe of Science Fiction
Foreword
Of late I have taken to the preparation of science
fiction anthologies, which is perhaps a sign of literary
senescence, though I like to think of it, rather, as
putting my mature wisdom and expertise at the
service of the science fiction reading public. After all,
I am by no means ceasing, or even slowing, my own
proper output. Besides, I must admit I generally make
use of coeditors, and sweet-talk them into taking care
of the more turgid aspects of the job—correspondence,
bookkeeping, and so on.

One of these recent anthologies was The 13 Crimes
of Science Fiction (Doubleday, 1979) in which my
coeditors were Martin Harry Greenberg and Charles
G. Waugh. For the anthology, I wrote an introduction
relating science fiction to other specialised fields of
writing, especially mysteries, and here it is.

Science fiction is a literary universe of no mean size because
science fiction is what it is, not through its content but
through its background. Let me explain the difference that
makes.
A ‘sports story’ must have, as part of its content, some
competitive activity, generally of an athletic nature. A
‘Western story’ must have, as part of its content, the
nomadic life of the cowboy of the American West in the
latter half of the nineteenth century. The ‘jungle story’
must have, as part of its content, the dangers implicit in a
forested tropical wilderness.
Take the content of any of these and place it against a
background that involves a society significantly different
from our own and you have not changed the nature of the
story—you have merely added to it.
A story may involve, not the clash of baseball and bat,
or of hockeystick and puck, but of gas gun and sphere in
an atmosphere enclosed on a space station under zero
gravity. It is still a sports story by the strictest definition
you care to make, but it is science fiction also.

o
n

d
e

197/ON SCIENCE FICTION

In place of the nomadic life of a cowboy and his horse
herding cattle, you might have the nomadic life of a fishboy
and his dolphin, herding his schools of mackerel and cod.
It could still have the soul of a Western story and be science
fiction also.
In place of the Matto Grosso, you can have the jungle
on a distant planet, different in key factors of the
environment, with exotic dangers in atmosphere, in
vegetation, in planetary characteristics never encountered
on Earth. It would still be a jungle story and be science
fiction also.
For that matter, you needn’t confine yourself to
category fiction. Take the deepest novel you can imagine,
one that most amply plumbs the secret recesses of the
soul and holds up a picture that illuminates nature and
the human condition, and place it in a society in which
interplanetary travel is common, and give it a plot which
involves such travel and it is not only great literature—it
is science fiction also.
John W. Campbell, the late great science fiction editor,
used to say that science fiction took as its domain, all
conceivable societies, past and future, probable or
improbable, realistic or fantastic, and dealt with all events
and complications that were possible in all those societies.
As for ‘mainstream fiction’ which deals with the here and
now and introduces only the small novelty of make believe
events and characters, that forms only an inconsiderable
fraction of the whole.
And I agree with him.
In only one respect did John retreat from this grand
vision of the limitless boundaries of science fiction. In a
moment of failure of nerve, he maintained that it was
impossible to write a science fiction mystery. The
opportunities in science fiction were so broad, he said,
that the strict rules that made the classical mystery story
fair to the reader could not be upheld.
I imagine that what he expected was the sudden change
of rules without warning in the midst of the story.
Something like this, I suppose—

‘Ah, Watson, what that scoundrel did not count on
was that with this pocket-frannistan which I have
in my pocket-frannistan Container I can see
through the lead lining and tell what is inside the
casket.’
‘Amazing, Holmes, but how does it work?’
‘By the use of Q-rays, a little discovery of my own
which I have never revealed to the world.’

d
e

h
s

Naturally, there is the temptation to do this. Even in
the classical mystery story that is not science fiction there
is the temptation to give the detective extraordinary
abilities in order to advance the plot. Sherlock Holmes’s
ability to distinguish, at sight, the ashes of hundreds of
different kinds of tobacco, while not perhaps in the same
class as the invention of a Q-ray at a moment’s notice, is
certainly a step in the direction of the unfair.
Then, too, there is nothing to prevent even the strictest
of strict mystery writers from using actual science, even
using the latest available findings of science, which the
reader may not have heard of. That is still considered fair.
There are dangers to that, however, since many
mystery writers know no science and cannot prevent
themselves from making bloopers. John Dickson Carr, in
one book, revealed that he didn’t know the difference
between the element, antimony, and the compound,
antimony potassium tartrate. That was only irritating, but
in another book, he demonstrated that he couldn’t tell the
difference between carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide
and reduced the plot to a shambles. One of Dorothy Sayers’
more grisly short stories involved the effect of thyroid
hormones and, though she had the right idea, she made
the effects impossibly rapid and extreme.
Writing a scientific mystery, then, has its extraordinary
pitfalls and difficulties; how much more so the writing of a
science fiction mystery. In science fiction, you not only
must know your science, but you must also have a rational
notion as to how to modify or extrapolate that science.

199/ON SCIENCE FICTION

That, however, only means that writing a science fiction
mystery is difficult; it does not mean that it is conceptually
impossible as John Campbell thought.
After all, it is as perfectly possible to cling to the rules
of the game in science fiction mysteries as in ordinary
ones.
The science fiction mystery may be set in the future
and in the midst of a society far different from ours; one in
which human beings have developed telepathy, for
instance, or in which light-speed mass transport is
possible, or in which all human knowledge is computerized
for instant retrieval—but the rules still hold.
The writer must carefully explain to the reader all
their boundary conditions of the imaginary society. It must
be perfectly clear what can be done and what can’t be
done and with those boundaries fixed, the reader must
then see and hear everything the investigator sees and
hears, and he must be aware of every clue the investigator
comes across.
There may be misdirection and red herrings to obscure
and confuse, but it must remain possible for the reader to
introduce the investigator, however outré the society.
Can it be done? You bet! Modestly, I refer you to my
own science fiction mysteries, The Caves of Steel and The
Naked Sun which I wrote, back in the 1950s, in order to
show John that he was being too modest about science
fiction.

What makes for the distinction between the various genres of
fiction—‘a sports story’, ‘a Western story’, ‘a jungle story’ and
science fiction?
How does Asimov establish that John Campbell was wrong in
his opinion that it is not possible for a science fiction mystery
to be fair to a reader in the same way as a classical mystery is?
What are the pitfalls that the writer of science fiction mystery
must guard against?

manner?
Mark the linkers used by the author to connect the point he

Pronunciation

Languages vary greatly in the way in which they use rhythm
in fluent speech. English rhythm is based not only on word
stress (i.e. the stress on a certain syllable or syllables in a
word) but also on sentence stress (i.e. the basic emphasis
pattern of a sentence). Both of these elements are important
for intelligibility.

Look at the following sentences
(i) Delhi is a big city.
(ii) He asked me how I felt in a big city like Delhi.
You will notice that the first sentence can be said in one breath,
but you may like to pause while saying the second sentence.
Pauses can be indicated by the mark (/). Each pause marks
the end of a ‘breath’ or tone group. Because tone groups are
said in a single breath, they are limited in length and average
about two seconds, or five words.

We br eak up spoken language into tone groups because we need
to breathe, so there is a physical reason for the structure. But
there is also the need to think. Thus the pace of the tone groups,
and the information they convey, matches the speakers’
thoughts. Tone groups can contain only one word or as many as
seven or eight, as you can see in the example given below

Good morning, this is Ten-2-Ten supermarket. Can I help you?
Good morning, I’d like to speak to the person in charge of your
After Sales Service, please.
That’s Mr Patel.
Could you put me through to him, please?
Who’s speaking, please?
My name’s Karandikar.
Just a moment, Mr Karandikar... I am sorry, Mr Patel’s line
seems to be busy.
Well, is there someone else who could help me?
There’s Mrs Paul. She’s the assistant manager, but she’s out
at the moment.
Look, this is quite important!
I’ll try Mr Patel’s line again for you,... trying to connect you.
Ah! finally, ... is that Mr Patel? Good morning, this is... Hello?...
oh no! I’m cut off.

Grammar: Some More Verb Classes
The verb have is followed by a noun phrase. Find the noun
phrases that follow have in the paragraph of the text that begins
“A ‘sports story must have…some competitive activity…” (In

202/K ALEIDOSCOPE

this example, have is followed by the noun phrase some
competitive activity.)
Sentences with have do not usually have a passive form. But
in general, verbs which take a noun phrase after them are
transitive, and they have a passive form. Look at the verbs in
the paragraph following the paragraph you have just worked
with. Find the noun phrases that follow the verbs take, place,
involve, change and add.
Notice that these verbs can all be passivized, and their objects
can become subjects (these have been set in bold below). So

Nothing prevents writers from using actual science.

He revealed that he didn’t know the difference between the

• He demonstrated that he couldn’t tell the difference between
carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide and reduced the plot to a

• The writer must carefully explain to the reader all the boundary
conditions of the imaginary society.
2.
Some verbs take a that-clause after them. Find the verb ask in
the last paragraph of the first part of this text (which begins ‘I
don’t even ask that…’) and note how it is followed by thatclauses. Look for other verbs, in this text as well as in the
earlier ones, that are followed by a that-clause (verbs such as
believe, know, realise, promise…).
