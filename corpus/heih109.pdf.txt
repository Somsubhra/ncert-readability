The comet – I

Before you read

A new comet has appeared in the sky and is heading straight for the
earth. A head-on collision, which is nearly unavoidable, will mean the
end of life on this planet. Scientists and religious leaders react to this
situation in two different ways. What happens to the comet?

• Duttada, an amateur scientist, can’t stay away from the
keen-eyed Dibya Chakshu for long.
• Dibya helps him achieve his secret ambition.
• Duttada’s wife, Indrani Debi, wishes he hadn’t found the object of his
search.

IT was a moonless night in December. A burst of cool breeze from
the window was enough to disturb the sleep of Indrani Debi. Half
awake she felt for the adjoining pillow, although she knew the
answer. Duttada was not there.
“So he has gone to hobnob with that wretched Dibya! At least he
might have bothered to close the door.” Even as she muttered her
complaints Indrani Debi could not repress her smile. She knew
how utterly oblivious her husband was of the practical problems of
living. Didn’t his doctor tell him to take special precautions against
the cold? But he wouldn’t remember to put on a sweater even if it

was lying on his bedside chair! How could he when Dibya had put
her spell on him?
She picked up the white woollen pullover, wrapped herself in a
shawl and made her way to the roof, to break up his tete-a-tete
with Dibya.
She found them both huddled together eye to eye. At least
Duttada was looking into Dibya’s eyes.
When Duttada acquired this telescope he was so thrilled that
he called it Dibya Chakshu — Divine Eye. To Indrani Debi the
telescope was like a designing woman who had ensnared her
husband. So she just called it Dibya and the name stuck.
To Duttada the telescope marked the fulfilment of the ambition
of a lifetime. As an amateur astronomer he had longed for enough
money to buy a good telescope and for enough spare time in which
to observe the heavens. He got them both when he retired with ample
money. The telescope was duly installed and long were the dark
nights that Duttada spent in star-gazing. At least Indrani Debi
thought so.

It so happened...

“Here! Put on this sweater — or do you want Nabin Babu to
order bed-rest tomorrow?”
Like every other amateur astronomer, Duttada had a secret ambition
that he would one day discover a new comet. For, comets can be new,
coming as they do from the remote corners of the Solar System. Like
planets, comets also orbit round the Sun but their orbits are highly
eccentric. So once in a while a comet comes close to the Sun; it has a
longish tail that is lit brilliantly by the sunlight and then it recedes
into darkness not to be seen again for years, or for centuries.
What chance did he stand with his eight-inch Dibya? Didn’t
professional astronomers have gigantic telescopes?
Duttada was optimistic... he knew that the professionals with
their pre-assigned programmes would be looking at faint stars and
nebulous galaxies. They might miss such an insignificant thing as
a comet which they were not expecting to see anyway! Indeed
amateurs had often discovered new comets which the professionals
had missed.
And, it looked to Duttada that tonight was going to be the big
night. For against the background of the same old stars Duttada
had detected a faint stranger. He re-examined the charts with him,
checked his Dibya for any smudges on the optics, did some
calculations on his pocket calculator in torchlight — for, though
absent-minded about daily chores, he was meticulous in
his observations.
Yes, there can be no mistake. What he was looking at had not
been there earlier and it did look like a new comet.
Two days later the Ananda Bazar Patrika came out with the news:

Calcutta Man Discovers New Comet
(From our special correspondent)

Shri Manoj Dutta, a resident on the northern outskirts of Calcutta* has
claimed to have discovered a new comet. He has seen the comet on the last
two nights and has informed the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) at
eccentric: unusual/unlike the orbits of other planets recedes: goes back; disappears

Bangalore* of its whereabouts. The IIA runs a 90-inch telescope, the biggest
in Asia, at Kavalur. If it confirms Dutta’s finding it will be the high point in
his lifelong career as amateur astronomer. Duttada, as he is affectionately
called by his friends and admirers, estimates that the comet would be clearly
visible to the naked eye in the next few months. He gives all credit for his
discovery to his eight-inch telescope which he calls Dibya.

Thereafter it took just one week for ‘Comet Dutta’ to be recognised
and so named. For the IIA confirmed the findings and communicated
it worldwide and, according to the accepted practice, the new comet
was named after its discoverer.
This brought in unwelcome publicity to the introvert Duttada.
There were numerous receptions and functions to attend. Returning
from one such ceremony Duttada muttered to himself in disgust, “I
almost wish I had not discovered this comet.”
To his surprise Indrani Debi agreed. “I wish the same, though
not for the same reason”.
“May I ask why you wish I had not discovered this comet?”
Duttada asked.
“Comets bring ill-luck and I wish a good man like you were not
associated with the discovery of one,” Indrani Debi said with concern.
Duttada laughed. “I see that even an MA degree has not cured
you of your superstitions! There is no corelation whatsoever with
the arrival of a comet and the calamities of the earth. On the contrary
comets have been scientifically studied and their composition is
well understood. There is nothing harmful about them. Well, you
will soon see this comet of mine pass harmlessly by causing no
anxiety to anybody.”
In this last comment, however, Duttada was not going to be
exactly right.

A British scientist writes a paper based on Duttada’s discovery.
He and the Defence Science Advisor have a tete-a-tete over an
impending calamity.
A conference of international experts might yield a clue to the

In the spacious dining hall of King’s College, Cambridge, the butler
whispered deferentially in the Provost’s ear and handed him an envelope
on a silver tray. The Provost beckoned James and passed on the
envelope saying, “It seems you are wanted urgently inyour room.”
As he made his way towards the beautiful building, James opened
the envelope. It contained a brief note:
Dear Dr Forsyth,
The bearer of this note has been instructed to bring you to my office in
London tonight. Please come without delay. I am making arrangements
for your overnight stay in London. I regret the inconvenience caused to
you and request you to keep your visit strictly confidential. Believe me, it
is absolutely essential.
Yours sincerely,
John Macpherson

A bowler-hatted man near the mantlepiece greeted him as James
entered his sitting room. “I am Johnson, sir. Security officer at
Whitehall.” He showed his identity card and continued, “I presume,
you know why I am here, sir.”
“To the extent that is conveyed in this note,” replied James. He
knew that it would be useless to ask Johnson for further details. “I
won’t take long.”
Johnson’s Ford Cortina brought them to Whitehall in less than
ninety minutes. It took them another ten minutes to reach the
chambers of Sir John Macpherson. Having introduced James to
Sir John, the quiet but efficient Johnson slipped out.
“Dr Forsyth, my apologies for this imposition on your time!” Sir
John advanced with outstretched hands. “To avoid any further delay,
I will come to the point right away.” Sir John handed him a
typescript.
“Why! It is my paper to Nature. How did you get this original
manuscript?” James was surprised and somewhat uneasy.
Sir John saw his anxiety and continued, “Taylor, the editor of
Nature is a friend of mine.”
“I had asked Nature to publish it without delay since it is very
important,” James looked puzzled.
“I agree that it is important. So important in fact that it must
never be published — that is, if what you say is correct.” Sir John
lit his pipe.
James would never have tolerated aspersions on the accuracy of his
work, or the implied order that it must be suppressed. But he knew Sir
John to be a respected scientist and was willing to hear him out.
“Please do not misunderstand me, Dr Forsyth. I met Taylor today
at lunch in the club where he showed me your paper — I still retain
enough interest in astronomy, you know — and he asked for my
opinion before sending it to a professional referee. I immediately
realised that your result has profound implications, if it is correct.”

“Let me assure you, Sir John, that it is correct. I stake my
reputation on it,” James could not contain himself any more.
“Do you realise what will happen if Comet Dutta collides with
the Earth, as you predict it will?”
“The effects will be catastrophic! That is why I have taken extra
care to verify my calculations. Barring rare circumstances, the
collision is inevitable.” James was confident. But Sir John picked
out the one qualifying phrase: “What are those rare circumstances?”
“Well, it might collide with some asteroid before reaching here.
Or it might just split up when near the Sun, or it might evaporate...”
“But one can’t count on these fortuitous circumstances. We have
to proceed on the assumption that Comet Dutta will collide with
the Earth. Cometary collisions are expected to occur once in ten
million years. But now we know that the next one will occur
in a year...”
“Ten months, to be precise,” interjected James.
“Thank you for the correction! Do you realise that we have only
ten months of survival left for the entire living species on the Earth?
Don’t you think we have to do something to stop all this?”
A fleeting smile crossed James’ face. ‘Just like a civil servant! As
if we are facing here a minor breakdown of law and order,’ he thought
to himself. Aloud, he said, “How, may I ask, can we prevent this
natural catastrophe?’
“I don’t know; but we have no option but to try. I think we need
more than two brains to handle this situation. It is essential to call
an urgent meeting of experts from all over the world to think of a
counter-measure and of course in total secrecy. Think of the panic
in the world if this dreadful news leaks out.” Sir John glanced at
the manuscript in James’ hand.
“My suppressing this paper will not hide the truth, Sir John!”
James said. “There are others who will arrive at the same conclusion,
sooner or later.”

“No. Do not suppress it but tone it down. Add many if’s and
but’s to make your conclusion appear not so certain... I will exert
all my influence with friends in other countries to make them
exercise a similar restraint for a while.”
“For how long?”
“Until this wretched comet is safely out of the way. Let us spend
some time now to plan the details of this international conference.
Shall we call it in a week’s time, here?”
A week to plan such an important secret conference of
international experts! James thought it an impossible task, but Sir
John disagreed, and began to spell out details.

Cold Causes Colds J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J
The common cold is the world’s most widespread illness– which
is probably why there are more myths about it than any of the
other illnesses.
A widespread fallacy is that colds are caused by cold. They
are not. They are caused by viruses passed on from person to
person. If cold causes colds, it would be reasonable to expect
the Eskimos to suffer from them permanently. But they
do not.
