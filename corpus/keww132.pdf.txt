Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have
governed my life: the longing for love, the search for
knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.
These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither
and thither, in a wayward course, over a deep ocean of
anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.
I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy—
ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the
rest of life for a few hours of this joy. I have sought it, next,
because it relieves loneliness—that terrible loneliness in
which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of
the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have
sought it, finally, because in the union of love, I have seen,
in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven
that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought
and, though it might seem too good for human life, this is
what at least I have found.
With equal passion, I have sought knowledge. I have
wished to understand the hearts of men. I have wished to
know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend
the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway over
the flux. A little of this, but not much, I have achieved.
Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led
upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me
back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my

heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors,
helpless old people a hated burden to their sons, and the
whole world of loneliness, poverty and pain make a mockery
of what human life should be. I long to alleviate the evil,
but I cannot, and I too suffer.
This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and
would gladly live it again if the chance were offered to me.

Bertrand Russell (1872–1969), the British
philosopher and mathematician, has written
numerous popular works on philosophy, politics
and education. He took a major part in the
twentieth century revival of logic and made
continued effort to identify the methods of philosophy with
those of the sciences. He received the Nobel Prize for
literature in 1950. The above passage is an extract from
Bertrand Russell’s Autobiography.

Read the summary of Martin Luther’s King’s distinction between
three kinds of love given below.

King’s sixth point was central to the method of non-violent resistance.
He believed that the importance of non-violence rested in the fact that
it prevented physical violence and the ‘internal violence of spirit’.
Bitterness and hate were absent from the resister’s mind, and replaced

with love. However, the kind of love King was talking about was not the
affectionate type but, instead, the type that meant ‘understanding,
redeeming good will for all people’. He further explained that in the
Greek New Testament, there were three words for love and each had a
different meaning. Eros was romantic love and philla was a reciprocal
love. Neither of these two types of love were the kind that King advanced.
Agape, which was not a passive love, was the kind of redemptive love he
referred to. According to King, “It is an overflowing love which is purely
spontaneous, unmotivated, groundless and creative. It is not set in
motion by any quality or function of its object. It is the love of God
operating in the human heart.”
Additionally, it was a love that was disinterested. The act of loving
was not for one’s own good but for the good of another. It did not
distinguish between worthy and unworthy people or friends and
enemies. Furthermore, it was love that fulfilled the need of another
person. A person was in greatest need of love when a sinner.
King also believed that agape sought to preserve and create community.
As a result, no distance was too far to travel in the attempt to restore
community. Agape was,
...a willingness to forgive, not seven times, but seventy times to
restore community. The cross is the eternal expression of the
length to which God will go in order to restore broken community.
The resurrection is a symbol of God’s triumph over all the forces
that seek to block community. The Holy Spirit is the continuing
community creating reality that moves through history. He who
works against community is working against the whole of creation.
Thus, hateful responses promote a broken community and instead one
must respond to hate with love in order to avoid becoming depersonalised
and to fix a broken community.
Lastly, agape means that every aspect of life is interrelated. All human
beings are related to one another and by harming another they harm
themselves.
Martin Luther King was a man who believed that the power of love
could be the most effective weapon against the social ills of society. He
promoted resistance that was nonviolent and, in the end, it proved to
be the most successful method against an unjust system of segregation.
