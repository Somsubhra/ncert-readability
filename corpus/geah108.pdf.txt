The lady in the manor-house had a bear as pet.
It was a most friendly bear, who loved vegetables, apples
and honey.
He roamed freely during the day, but was put on the chain
at night.

THERE was once a lady who lived in an old manor-house on
the border of a big forest. This lady had a pet bear she was
very fond of. It had been found in the forest, half dead of
hunger, so small and helpless that it had to be brought up
on the bottle by the lady and the old cook. This was several
years ago and now it had grown up to a big bear, so big
and strong that he could have slain a cow and carried it
away between his two paws if he had wanted to. But he did
not want to; he was a most amiable bear who did not dream
of harming anybody, man or beast. He used to sit outside
his kennel and look with his small intelligent eyes most
amicably at the cattle grazing in the field near by. The three
shaggy mountain ponies in the stable knew him well and
did not mind in the least when he shuffled into the stable
with his mistress. The children used to ride on his back
and had more than once been found asleep in his kennel
between his two paws. The three dogs loved to play all sorts
of games with him, pull his ears and his stump of a tail

and tease him in every way, but he did not mind it in the
least. He had never tasted meat; he ate the same food as
the dogs and often out of the same plate—bread, porridge,
potato, cabbage, turnip. He had a fine appetite, and his
friend, the cook, saw to it that he got his fill. Bears are
vegetarians if they have a chance, and fruit is what they
like best. In the autumn he used to sit and look with wistful
eyes at the ripening apples in the orchard, and in his young
days he had been sometimes unable to resist the temptation
to climb the tree and help himself to a handful of them.
Bears look clumsy and slow in their movements, but try a
bear with an apple tree and you will soon find out that he
can easily beat any school boy at that game. Now he had
learnt that it was against the law, but he kept his small
eyes wide open for any apples that fell to the ground. There
had also been some difficulties about the beehives; he had
been punished for this by being put on the chain for two
days with a bleeding nose and he had never done it again.
Otherwise he was never put on the chain except for the

night and quite rightly so, for a bear, like a dog, is apt to get
somewhat ill-tempered if kept on the chain, and
no wonder.
The lady visited her sister every Sunday, leaving the bear
on the chain the whole afternoon.
One Sunday, while walking through the dense forest, she
found him following her.
She was so angry with the disobedient bear that she hit
him on the nose with her umbrella. But the bear was really
friendly...

He was also put on the chain on Sundays when his
mistress went to spend the afternoon with her married sister
who lived in a solitary house on the other side of the
mountain-lake, a good hour’s walk through the dense
forest. It was not supposed to be good for him to wander
about in the forest with all its temptations; it was better to
be on the safe side. He was also a bad sailor and had once
taken such a fright at a sudden gust of wind that he had
upset the boat and he and his mistress had to swim to the
shore. Now he knew quite well what it meant when his
mistress put him on the chain on Sundays, with a friendly
tap on his head and the promise of an apple on her return
if he had been good during her absence. He was sorry but
resigned, like a good dog, when his mistress tells him he
cannot come with her for a walk.
One Sunday when the lady had chained him up as usual
and was about half-way through the forest, she suddenly
thought she heard the cracking of a tree-branch on the
winding footpath behind her. She looked back and was
horrified to see the bear coming along full speed. Bears
look as if they move along quite slowly but they shuffle
along much faster than a trotting horse. In a minute he
had joined her, panting and sniffing, to take up his usual

place, dog-fashion, at her heels. The lady was very angry,
she was already late for lunch, there was no time to take
him back home, she did not want him to come with her,
and, besides, it was very naughty of him to have disobeyed
her. She told him in her severest voice to go back at once,
menacing him with her parasol. He stopped a moment and
looked at her with his cunning eyes, but did not want to go
back and kept on sniffing at her. When the lady saw that
he had even lost his new collar, she got still more angry
and hit him on the nose with her parasol so hard that it
broke in two. He stopped again, shook his head and opened
his big mouth several times as if he wanted to say
something. Then he turned round and began to shuffle

back the way he had come stopping now and then to look
at the lady till at last she lost sight of him.
When the lady came home in the evening, the bear was
sitting in his usual place outside his kennel looking very
sorry for himself. The lady was still very angry. She went
up to him and began to scold him most severely and said
he would have to be chained for two more days. The old
cook who loved the bear as if he had been her son rushed
out from the kitchen very angry.
“What are you scolding him for, missus,” said the cook;
“he has been as good as gold the whole day, bless him! He
has been sitting here quite still on his haunches as meek
as an angel, looking the whole time towards the gate for
you to come back.”

AXEL MUNTHE

Answer the following questions.
1. Where did the lady find the bear cub? How did she bring it up?
2. The bear grew up but “he was a most amiable bear”. Give three
examples to prove this.
3. What did the bear eat? There were two things he was not allowed
to do. What were they?
4. When was the bear tied up with a chain? Why?
5. What happened one Sunday when the lady was going to her sister’s
house? What did the lady do? What was the bear’s reaction?
6. Why was the bear looking sorry for himself in the evening? Why
did the cook get angry with her mistress?

Discuss the following topics in groups.
1. Most people keep dogs and cats as pets. Can you think of some
unusual pets that people keep?
2. The second bear did not attack the lady because he was afraid of
her. Do you agree?

Whose Side?

Once during the American Civil War a woman said to
Abraham Lincoln, “Oh, Mr President, I feel so sure God
is on our side, don’t you?”
“Ma’ am,” said the President, “what should be of
greater concern to us is whether we are on God’s side.”
