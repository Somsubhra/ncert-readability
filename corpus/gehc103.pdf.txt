Working with Language

1. Notice how in a comic book, there are no speech marks
when characters talk. Instead what they say is put in a
speech ‘bubble’. However, if we wish to repeat or ‘report’
what they say, we must put it into reported speech.
Change the following sentences in the story to reported
speech. The first one has been done for you.

had paid for that hilsa.

The Shed
Do you know what a shed is? A cow shed, a tool
shed, a wood shed, for example. It’s a small room,
away from the main house, for storing or keeping
things, animals, tools, vehicles, etc. Ask your
partner if she/he has ever seen a shed. Let her/
him describe it to the class.

Now read the poem.

There’s a shed at the bottom of our garden
With a spider’s web hanging across the door,
The hinges are rusty and creak in the wind.
When I’m in bed I lie and I listen,
I’ll open that door one day.

THE SHED/49

There’s a dusty old window around at the side
With three cracked panes of glass,
I often think there’s someone staring at me
Each time that I pass,
I’ll peep through that window one day.
My brother says there’s a ghost in the shed
Who hides under the rotten floorboards,
And if I ever dare to set foot inside
He’ll jump out and chop off my head,
But I’ll take a peek one day.

I know that there isn’t really a ghost,
My brother tells lies to keep the shed for his den;
There isn’t anyone staring or making strange noises
And the spider has been gone from his web
since I don’t know when,
I’ll go into that shed one day soon,
But not just yet...

Working with the Poem

1. Answer the following questions.
(i) Who is the speaker in the poem?
(ii) Is she/he afraid or curious, or both?
(iii) What is she/he planning to do soon?
(iv) “But not just yet...” suggests doubt, fear, hesitation,
laziness or something else. Choose the word which
seems right to you. Tell others why you chose it.
2. Is there a room in your house or a house in your
neighbourhood/locality where you would rather not go
alone, and never at night? If there is such a place and a
story to go with it, let others hear all about it.
