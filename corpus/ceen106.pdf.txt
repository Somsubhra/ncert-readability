Trains

Over
Over
Over
Here

the mountains,
the plains,
the rivers,
come the trains.

Carrying passengers,
Carrying mail,
Bringing their precious loads
In without fail.

Thousands of freight cars
All rushing on
Through day and darkness,
Through dusk and dawn.

Over
Over
Over
Here

the mountains,
the plains,
the rivers,
come the trains.

It is early morning.
The road is asleep.

Everything is quiet.
But listen!

The birds are calling softly.

“Chirrup, chirrup, chirrup,” say the sparrows.
“Chirrup, chirrup, chirrup.”

“Caw, caw caw,” says the crow.

“Caw, caw caw,” “wake up, wake up.”
Here is someone else now.

“Tring-a-ling, tring-a-ling.”
It is the newspaper boy.

Let’s Move

Crouch low, then rise, take off and move around the room.
Come down like a rocket and dance to:
Up, up, up in a rocket, up we'll go, up we'll go,
Up, up, up in a rocket, A-way-up high we'll go.

The Race
I am going home in a bus.
There is a railway line alongside the road.
Look, there is a train coming.
I tell the bus driver, “Go fast!
Go faster than the train!”
But the driver slows down.
There is a railway gate.
“I must stop,” says the driver
The train whistles loudly.
“I am first!” it says.

SUGGESTIONS FOR CLASSROOM TEACHING
Read
l

UNIT VI

the poem aloud with appropriate expressions. Explain the difficult
words in the text like freight cars, precious, plains, dusk, dawn etc.

Give
l

information about different land forms like mountains, plains, valleys
etc. Talk about places where trains can run and where they cannot (e.g. high
mountains). You can discuss different modes of transport on land. You can
also talk about the different kinds of roads around your town or village and the
local modes of transport used here e.g. bullock carts, camels, cycles, buses,
scooters etc.

Cut out some sheets of paper in squares for the paper folding activity and give
l
one piece to each child. You may even use old newspapers for making an
aeroplane. Do allow the children to enjoy the activity by flying them in the
class/ground for one period. However, make sure that the children pick up all
the bits of paper once the activity is over.

Emphasise
l

the importance of cleanliness of one’s surroundings. Dustbins
should be kept in the classroom and in a corner of the school playground for
all waste paper, fruit peels, wrappers etc.

Help the children to enact The Race.
l
The class
l

can also be made to enact a scene from a railway
station (have characters like porters, vendors, passengers,
etc.).

Look at the picture and write four sentences about
what you see.
1. I can see a tree.

Let children
l

enjoy moving to a beat and playing instruments in
rhythm. They can sing to the accompaniment of rhythmic sounds
made with their hands, feet, mouth, etc. with other parts of their
bodies.
