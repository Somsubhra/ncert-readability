Hands to wipe
and fingers and toes
and two wet legs
and a shiny nose.

Just think how much
less time I’d take
if I were a dog
and could shake, shake, shake.

The Bubble, the Straw and the Shoe
Listen and enjoy this story
Once upon a
time there lived a
Bubble, a Straw
and a Shoe.
One day they
went into the
forest.
They came to a
river. They did
not know how to
cross it.
The Shoe said,
“Bubble, let us float on you.”
“No, Shoe! Let Straw stretch himself from one bank to the

other. Then we can cross the river.”
So, the Straw stretched himself from one bank to the other.
When the Shoe jumped on the Straw, it broke. The Shoe fell
into the water with a loud splash.
The Bubble shook and shook with laughter and burst with a
big bang.

Story — The Bubble, the Straw

UNIT

Teacher's Pages

Conversation is a very important and natural activity for the development of
vocabulary and speech patterns. In Unit 2, involve all the children in these
joyful interactive sessions. Encourage them with phrases such as, “Please
try”, or “Oh! You are so good!” Appreciate every child's efforts and ensure a
feeling of success for all the children. Consider the abilities of each child.
Develop listening skills
4
Practice the poem and say it aloud to the children.
Read the story with emphasis on new words and enable them to bring
experiences into reading for understanding and enriching their
imagination.
Develop pronunciation

Read the text and say aloud with the children

Exposure to language

Use sight words in the classroom by putting visuals and cue cards. Let
the child read these:
draw
straw

hen
pen

pit
wit

dog
log

blue
glue

Develop speaking skills
4
1. Have a talk on brushing teeth, washing hands, hygiene etc.
2. Conversation based on ‘Role play’
Divide the class into four groups Red , Yellow , Blue , Green
l
Group Red: Let them say, ‘I try to save water’ as they wipe
themselves with towels.
Group Blue: Involve the children in an activity e.g. cleaning the
cobwebs with sticks/mops or tidying the classroom or class
cupboard. Let them say, ‘I try to clean my space.’
Group Yellow: Mix some soap in a bowl of water. Stir it to build up
bubbles. Use it for the floating/sinking activity if you like.
Group Green: Let them pick up papers, wrappers etc. from the
school playground and put them into dustbins.
All groups are to make cutouts which can be hung in the
l
class/outdoors/on the door/on the walls/on the trees.

Imagine

you are walking down a street and you see a friend far
away. Wave out and call your friend.

Develop writing skills / fine motor coordination
1. (a) Write on the blackboard a, e, i, o, u and 1 to 10. Let the child
write numbers and trace a few letters. These are the child’s
attempts at writing. The teacher can gradually lead the child to
proper formation of letters. Also provide each child with a
comfortable writing position, adequate space and an
appreciative atmosphere.
(b) Each child's grip on the pencil and appropriate colouring within
lines must be looked into.
(c) Use Activity Sheets to further encourage the patterns as on
pages 19, 20, 23, 24, 25 and 26 and numbers 1 to 10 (here
co-ordinate with the maths teacher). However, do not force the
child.
2. Enact a situation when your writing hand is hurt and you have to
write.
3. Show children how to open and
