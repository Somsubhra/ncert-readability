Good Morning

Good Morning, sky;
Good Morning, sun;
Good Morning, little winds that run!
Good Morning, birds;
Good Morning, trees;
And creeping grass, and brownie bees!
How did you find out it was day?
Who told you night had gone away?
I’m wide awake;
I’m up now, too.
I’ll be right out to play with you!

The Magic Garden
The magic garden was in a school playground. It was very pretty.
Sunflowers and roses stood high against the wall. There were
also marigolds, poppies and pansies.

ed

The sunshine fell on this garden more than on any other and
the flowers danced and sang happily. They said to one another,
“We have hundreds of little gardeners.” They were the children
from the school.

“I love all the children, but I love the dear little ones
most of all,” said a poppy. “I like them to bring their
watering cans and water my thirsty roots.”

“Yes,” said the marigolds, “the boys are good to us too.

They dig the ground so well!”

“We love the little children,” said a tiny bird. “They are kind
and they bring bread for us.”
All the flowers said, “We must work hard to make our dresses
very pretty, for the children will be here soon.”

The sun said, “I will help you also, for nothing pleases me
better than to see the children running about in the golden
sunshine.”
Suddenly, the children came out laughing and singing, and
the flowers stopped their songs to listen to them.
“Oh, look at the tall sunflower!” said one child, and the
sunflower lifted its head very proudly.
Another child said, “I love the marigold in its golden dress.”
The marigold smiled happily.
