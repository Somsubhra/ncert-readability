The slow, narrow-gauge Indian train with its awkward freak
of an engine had a way of making unauthorised stops for
no good reason, between fields of corn or at the foot of a
village—it was said that the guard signalled a halt to pluck
a pumpkin or ripe melons from its stem or to buy fistfuls of
green gram from a peasant. Some of the passengers
grumbled and sat with drawn brows, composing in their
minds angry letters to Authority, or to the Press, but others
seized the chance to slip merrily out of doors for a breath
of air and a view of the green fields.
Satyajit, languid on the cushioned bench now vacated
by the other occupants, reached out for his cigarettes but,
on second thought, withdrew his hand brusquely. That won’t
do, he told himself with a stern shake of his head. His
smoke was rationed. He had attuned himself in the past
month to a fast-growing list of denials, large and small,
and this was one. How can he afford the unrestricted luxury
of chain smoking? Life lay sharpening to realities that still
had the semblance of an undreamable dream.
He winced, the turning wheel of fortune in his unhappy
eye, as always. Along the orbit of reminiscence he went

o
n

round and round, pulled by a force beyond his will. The
banking establishment of which he had attained control.
The amazing tempo of it all. Luck had come his way,
undeniably, but behind it was his mind, his initiative, grit,
energy. Starting as a mere clerk he had become Managing
Director. And now? What now?
Tall, thin, near forty, he had sharp features, the hair
receding on his temple in wide shiny smooth patches. His
eyes hated glare and he wore smart eye-glasses to shield
them. His mouth, thin-lipped, would tighten in repose to a
line that suggested strength of will but might have been
only pride.
‘What now?’ he said to himself in an underbreath. Those
words had become his obsession. ‘What now?’
He had no business to be on this wretched train on a
neglected railroad, travelling away from the city where he
must look for work, for the means of living. With the sudden
collapse of his bank, all his private assets were gone
overnight; the equities; the house on Tagore Street; even
the two cars, his and his wife’s. A mercy that she was
away from the scene, with her parents at Delhi, and
unaware of the full extent of the ruin. A telegram had come
last Tuesday announcing the safe birth of her child. Their
first-born, for he had married late in life. His son, his heir.
And he had sold off his diamond ring to send his young
wife a remittance for the name-giving rites.
She had married a man of fortune—that made it harder
for him in this crisis. True, she knew all about his earlier
life. But that was story-book stuff. It could be narrated
happily to their first-born when he grew older. The story
lay killed by its sequel—failure. Glory was all overlaid with
dark shame. Glory was dead.
It would be easy enough today if there were none else
to think of except himself. Born in a humble village home,
self-educated, struggle had been his life-breath. How
grateful he was for the clerkship he secured. A turning of
the wheel of fortune? he had wondered. The next turning,
a year after, was more dramatic. What made him give a
fixed look to the man beyond the brass grille of the counter?
The cheque presented for encashment was not a large sum.

Eye upon eye. Alarm vivid in the face and the hand on the
counter shaking curiously. Surprised, stirred by a quick
impulse, he took the cheque to the accounts desk, compared
the signature with the one on record. It tallied. But that
face, that hand. A hundred reasons, none connected with
the cheque, could explain the face and hand. Even so, the
impulse led him to the telephone. ‘Sir, have you signed a
bearer cheque for Rs 2,000? It has yesterday’s date...’ ‘Rs
2,000? No.’ His heart felt pain for lack of air. ‘Sir, are you
sure? The signature seems okay.’ In the next instance he
was back to his counter in a rush. Where was the man?
There, close to the exit, and the face turning back for a
moment wore stark fear. He was going away.
Feet bounded up the counter. The bank clerk hunted
down his prey on the gravel path, twenty paces from the
front door. There was no struggle. The man crumpled down
in a heap. He squatted with head between his hands, looking
down, tears rolling down. ‘Why did you have to commit
forgery?’ ‘She has TB.’ ‘She?’ ‘She is dying for want of
medicine.’ ‘Who?’ ‘My wife. I saw no other means. I give
lessons in Maths to the rich man’s son. That money...’ The
head between the hands wagged from side to side in a
queer rhythmic frenzy.
That was the way the clerk grew into an accountant.
He deserved what he had gained. He was not made to be a
mere clerk. Lost in the thrill, he had honest contempt for
his stepping-stone, the forgerer. You could not commit such
a crime even to save your dying wife. But today, as he sat
on his lone bench on the train, he saw mind-pictures and
felt troubled. The crouched figure on the gravel path
wrapped in mute grieving. The prisoner at the bar, face
frozen, as though he had died within himself. Had he
anything to say to the Court? the Judge had asked. ‘Punish
me.’ ‘Is that all?’ ‘Punish me as a killer.’ ‘Killer?’ ‘I have put
my wife to shame. Shame kills as fast as TB.’
Yes, that wretched one had turned the wheel for him
with his trembling hand. From that point the wheel attained
a volition of its own, moving continuously. He had every
reason to be grateful to the forgerer. Too late now to seek
him out, give him a chance to live?

Too late. He himself sorely needed a chance to live.
The banking business lay around him in a broken mass
and there was he, prostrate on his face in the wreckage,
sucking its dust. All his fault. He had tried to overreach
himself. Each wrong step was now clear in time’s
perspective. The run on the bank had come all too suddenly
though. Failure had a tempo far faster than success.
He had great need to fly from himself—that was why he
was on this train. A letter had come in the nick of time offering
him an excuse, a temporary relief from the wrenching within.
‘The wedding of my fifth daughter, Beena, is to take
place on the twentieth of this month. I have kept you posted
with the progress of negotiations. I seek your benediction as
in the case of my second, third and fourth daughters—
Kamini, Damini and Suhashi. With Beena wedded, there
will be only Aruna left, and she is in her tenth year. Your
benediction alone can pull me through the present daughter
crisis. That is all I have to say—Your helpless Uncle Srinath.’
Daughter crisis, indeed! mused Satyajit with a dim
smile. Uncle Srinath, a neighbour at Shantipur village but
no blood relation, seemed to have been producing his
numerous daughters secure in the faith that others would
bear the brunt of the repeated crises of their marriage
needs. And Satyajit, in the flush of prosperity, had been
more than open-handed. It was a matter of pride, selfsatisfaction.
In his younger days, the village people had not thought
much of him, had not seen in him any special gift or
brilliance. One of the common herd. That was all the more
reason why he enjoyed success. He needed the wide-eyed
wonder and eager homage of Uncle Srinath and the like
while they had use and longing for his money. It was plain
give-and-take.
All that was over. Fallen from his castle in the clouds,
Satyajit must tread the earthly ways of humble folk. But
he could not deny the old man altogether. He must send
some help. He had pondered over the amount. He had to
ponder over each rupee before he spent it.
Then, all at once, he had come to a decision. He would
go to Shantipur and attend the marriage. This would be a

welcome relief—the city was suffocating him. His mind
would be freshened, his strength renewed for the coming
struggle by a return to the physical scene which had been
his starting point in life. Let that be his starting point once
more, outwardly as much as in the spirit. He would also
take this chance to look at his ancestral house and fishpond, both leased out, bits of property still intact amid the
vast demolition. Those he must pass on to his wife as his
last gift. And he had sent word to Uncle Srinath about his
arrival on the marriage day.
The engine came to life with a shrill of warning.
The passenger hurried back. Another half-hour and it
was Shantipur. Satyajit leaned out of the door, his eyes
looking for Uncle Srinath on the station platform, where
m a n y p e o p l e s t o o d c r o w d e d t o g e t h e r, a l e r t a n d
apparently excited, one of them holding aloft the national
flag on a bamboo pole. A political celebrity on the train?
Strange that Uncle Srinath, who had always feared
politics, was leading the group. Suddenly, there was a
rush of legs towards Satyajit as he stepped down. The
legs stopped and a booming chorus followed. Swagatam!
Welcome!’
A small girl with an awestruck face stepped up with a
jasmine garland in her hand. Satyajit stood in a daze of
bewilderment as the girl rose on tiptoe to place the chain
of flowers around his neck. He bent mechanically to receive
the offer, not knowing what it meant. It was obviously a
mistake, a very curious one.
‘Welcome!’ the voices rang again. Then, an expectant
hush. Uncle Srinath turned round to the group. On the
high cheekbones and grey stubble of his face was a clear
coating of strong elation.
‘Friends and brothers! Bengal has seen greatness in
almost every field of action. I shall not belittle your
knowledge by citing names. It is only in trade and industry
that Bengal has lagged behind sadly—the plums of
business have gone to people from upcountry or from
overseas. That is why our hearts grow big with pride at
the sight of a son of Bengal, a son of our own Shantipur
village, who has attained great success in that field, that

forbidden field, and become the glory of the motherland,
Swagatam! Welcome!’
‘Swagatam!’ the combined voices roared while the
tricolour flag on its tall pole nodded approvingly.
When Satyajit slipped down from the ox cart at the
door of a mud-brick house, a knot of women waiting tensely
with brass water-bowls rushed up and stooped over his
feet, scrambling for the privilege to wash his feet with cool
water. Satyajit shrank back, embarrassed.
‘It’s my Beena’s privilege,’ cried Srinath, smiling. ‘This
is her day. Let Beena alone wash and wipe the reverent
feet. All her life she will remember this honour befalling
her on the auspicious day of her marriage.’
Satyajit looked at the girl who stepped forward, shy,
slender with large pensive eyes in a graceful face. ‘So this is
the bride,’ he smiled at her and touched her hair in the gesture
of blessing. ‘I hope the groom is worthy of this girl,’ he said as
she knelt down to unlace his
shoes. She slipped off his socks
and poured cool water to freshen
his feet, washing them with keen
care. As her slim fingers went
between his toes, he
wiggled them, for he
felt ticklish. Presently
he sat on a carpet in
the inner verandah
with a plateful of
sweets and a glass of
whey while Kamini,
Damini and Suhashi
sat near him on their
haunches and waved
palm leaf fans with
all their energy, as
though each passing
minute had to be fully
used before their
hands were deprived
of the privilege. Sweat

broke out on their faces and they shifted their fans from right
hand to left and again to the right. Their mother, who stood
by, now spoke in a murmur, husky with emotion.
‘You have been more of a father to these girls than he,’
jerking her head at her invisible husband. ‘But for the
bigness of your heart, they would still be maids under this
room, shooting up in years and in height with no chance of
having husband and home.’ She lifted her sari fringes to
her eyes, wiping off two grateful tears.
The meal over, Uncle Srinath, who had been shuttling
between the inner verandah and the outer quarters, now
stopped, leaning over his guest.
‘Beena has been given the old jewellery of her mother,’
he confided. ‘So, that part of the dowry problem has been
met. Her three married sisters, whom you see before you
and who owe all their bliss in life to your benediction, have
given her the marriage gifts she must have: sari, jacket,
chemise. Also brass utensils for her new household.’
‘Good! Good!’ Satyajit cried happily. He had Rs 200
in his purse and had wondered how much of it had to go
into the marriage pool. May be Rs 100; or, rather, Rs
101, since a figure ending with zero was not propitious.
During the meal he had been slowly adding to that figure:
ten, twenty, finally stopping at an additional fifty. Now
that Beena had got all she needed, he could just as well
slice a goodly bit off the amount. Let it be Rs 101. The
fifty rupees saved would buy a perambulator for his
newborn son.
‘Your benediction is our blind-man’s staff,’ Srinath went
on. ‘Do I have to say more?’ He apparently decided that he
did not, for he changed the topic abruptly. ‘My house has
become a place of pilgrimage. You are the pride of the village,
its strength. In you the people see their own inmost dream
fulfilled. Will you now show yourself for a minute to the
devotees who sit waiting—’
Satyajit followed his host. His devotees were seated on
a floor mat, talking animatedly, and at the sight of him
there was an instant hush. Hands joined to his chest,
Satyajit made salutation to all. He caught sight of the
schoolmaster who had taught him as a boy and made a

deep obeisance. Swelled with pride, the old man swept the
floor mat group with a superior glance before he spoke:
‘Didn’t I say? Didn’t I say a hundred and one times in
those far off days that the light of genius blazed on the face
of my young pupil? That he stood apart from every other
young pig—’ He broke short and yielded to a violent fit of
coughing to cover up the slip. Presently he resumed: ‘That
he with the light of genius on his face was afar from the
world where the other youngsters dwelt? Why, I predicted
that he would be a High Court Judge—’
Satyajit burst into a laugh. ‘Alas, I am no High Court
Judge’. ‘Even more, much more!’ counted the old man. His
good memory reached back to the boy with whom he had
been on terms of a perpetual feud. Always bent on some
kind of mischief—he did have an inventive mind that way!
Arithmetic was his bogey. How does he count all his pile of
money? He owns a million, if Srinath is to be believed. A
million? And the old man hastened to add a brushful of
colour to the drab picture presented by memory. ‘Even in
those far-off days I could see two shadow forms about him,
clear as life—Saraswati at his left, Lakshmi at his right.
And I knew even then that the twin goddesses of knowledge
and wealth, though hating the sight of each other, had for
once united, stayed together, drawn by their common love.’
He lifted joined palms to his forehead, offering salutation—
perhaps to those goddesses.
Satyajit was determined to enjoy himself. He felt a
twinge of regret that he had not thought of coming to
Shantipur and basking in the people’s homage when it was
truly his due. Now he was an impostor. He impersonated
the man he had been a few weeks before. He made an
angry jerk of his hand about his face, waving off a sandfly—and the regret. Let him be happy for the day even with
a false echo, let him be wrapped a while in the lingering
twilight splendour of departed glory. Tommorow he would
be in the full fury of a stream, tugged under water, fighting
for life. Today he would have his last breath of peace,
freedom, content.
Through the rest of the day he went round the village,
meeting the elders, sipping the proffered milk of green

coconuts. He visited his house occupied by a tenant. His
house—and he touched the walls possessively. This small
house gave him a feeling of security which had not come to
him even from his huge city mansion. He spent an hour by
the fish pond. His pond—and he sprinkled a palmful of its
water on his head. A good-sized carp landed at the end of
his hook. When he came home with the catch, Uncle Srinath
gazed at it raptly—one would have thought he had never
before seen such fish. ‘What gills!’ he breathed in apparent
ecstasy. He patted the head of the fish with an affectionate
hand. ‘Bride and groom shall eat curried portions of this
auspicious one when they break their marriage fast at
midnight. That will bring them all the blessings that life
can give’. It was near twilight when the groom’s party arrived
in ox carts and palanquins. Conches blew welcome. Young
women gathered at the dooryard and gave the shrill
traditional greeting expressive of great joy; Ulu-ulu-uluulu-ulu! When the bridal party was well settled, chewing
betel leaf and waiting for the marriage hour as prescribed
by the almanac, Satyajit felt for his purse. Time now to
part with Rs 101. Srinath, reading his thoughts, took him
to the secluded darkness under a fig-tree in the backyard
‘My begging bowl is ready,’ he announced happily.
‘Yes, yes,’ Satyajit nodded.
‘The cash dowry stands fixed. Only Rs 2001.’
‘What!’ Satyajit felt a hard blow in the pit of his
stomach.
‘That is all.’
‘Rs 2001?’
Srinath smiled. ‘Everything else is provided for, even
the cost of the marriage feast. Only this last item awaits
your benediction.’
Benediction—Srinath’s favourite word. Nothing
abstract in its meaning. It could be interpreted only in
terms of money. Satyajit felt a burning inside him. He had
stretched his leg right into the snare of benediction,
unthinkingly. How could he be so very stupid?
Srinath broke the silence with a half laugh. ‘This drop
in the ocean of your fortune. It shames me to mention the
petty figure.’

‘Why didn’t you write and tell me?’ The voice was harsh.
The half laugh repeated itself. ‘Have I no sense? I
am not such a big ass as I look. What! Mention money
to a millionaire! And such a pittance. A drop in the
ocean.’
‘A drop,’ echoed Satyajit, his mouth dry. This was the
moment for confession. He was even worse off than Srinath.
Hard struggle lay ahead of him for bare survival. Srinath
would understand.
‘Millionaire!’ Rhapsody in the voice. Plain worship on
the face. A devotee, prayerful before his god. ‘ We bask in
your benediction. Our life-spark itself is held in your fist;
you can destroy it just by closing your fingers tight. Words
cannot say what I feel —’
Yes, the god had been a millionaire, truly. That was
yesterday. Today... Confession stuck in his throat, clutched
by the millionaire’s dead hand. Better give an excuse. He
had come rushing in the midst of heavy work and had not
thought of equipping himself with adequate cash. That
would sound plausible. Later—it wouldn’t matter if Srinath
discovered the terrible truth later, as he must.
Something stronger than he spoke with his tongue. ‘I
had to catch the morning train—there was no time to go to
the bank. Maybe someone in the village—’ The words ‘cash
a cheque’ were almost on his lips. ‘Someone in the village
will advance a loan—’
Uncle Srinath rushed out of the house, panic on his
face. He had been under the impression that a millionaire
always had his pockets stuffed with money. Satyajit returned
to the assembled guests. Instantly the groom, on his foothigh satin-draped platform, fat round cushions on three
sides of him, was forgotten. Silence. All eyes took their fill
of the rich man. A god on the pedestal of fortune. He too
sat quiet, the tiredness within him heavier than even before.
The peace he had attained erstwhile was gone. He longed
to see the face of his new-born son. The rich man’s son
who would never ride in a perambulator.
Srinath returned in half an hour. His face looked angry.
Satyajit saw his beckoning hand, rose heavily to his feet,
and stepped outside, away from the people.

‘Only one person in Shantipur can produce so much
cash at this late hour,’ said Srinath, ‘Harish, the moneylender. That shark refuses to make an advance though.’
The swift flood of relief! ‘Harish does not trust me?’
Moneylenders did have a sixth sense. There was no knowing
when Harish would have got his money back—perhaps never.
‘Preposterous! Not to trust the word and signature of a
millionaire! Harish is off his senses; or, is it malice?’ The
voice collected anger. ‘I could drag him to you and make
him grovel at your feet and rub his fat nose on the ground.’
Satyajit could be generous. ‘No need, no need. Trust is
out of date in these cynical times.’ The wonder of it—his
leg was off the snare of benediction!
‘Where will our India be if such things are tolerated?
What is Nehru doing about it? Is there no one to tell him
how things stand in the country?’
Satyajit patted the excited man on the shoulder,
soothingly. Srinath controlled himself with visible effort.
His face saddened. ‘What is to be done?’ he moaned. ‘The
groom’s father is a man of stone. He will break off the
marriage unless cash is paid to him before the ceremony
starts. Who will ever marry Beena after such dishonour?’
Satyajit wagged his head in befitting sympathy. ‘If only
you had written to me. Just two words or three. Anyway,
do not be worried. You will find another suitable match, a
better one maybe. Who can foresee the ways of destiny?’
He felt for his purse the second time. He ought to restore
the fifty rupees he had cut. Let it be Rs 151. Even if there
would be no perambulator for his son—
Srinath cleared his throat twice. ‘It shames me to tell
you the full story.’
‘Yes?’
‘Harish is willing to pay.’
‘What! you have just said—’
‘He will pay against security. He wants security, that
evil-eyed shark. Your house and fish-pond. The madness!
To think that house and pond have more weight than a
millionaire’s signature!’
Satyajit trembled within him. ‘House and pond,’ he
murmurmed to himself. The only possessions that had not

toppled into the deluge. They were all he could give to his
wife—
‘All the old values destroyed, where will our India be?
Has Nehru no sense to understand this? What! A pond
weighs more than a millionaire’s word, a house is better
security than the signature of his hand! Yet, what else is
to be done?’ Palms folded together made supplication. ‘What
else is to be done in the daughter crisis?’
Satyajit had a queer drugged look. And the dead voice
of the millionaire came from his throat. ‘Let the moneylender pay on those terms.’
‘The insult, what about the insult?’ Srinath’s wrathful
hand cleaved the air. ‘When the thing is done, I will make
the shark rub his fat nose on the ground at your feet; I will
do that, be sure. You will also see the whole village spit at
the shark, thoo!’
The deed was signed, the house was gay with marriage
music. Satyajit walked off to the deep dark under the fig
tree, all by himself.
‘What now,’ he said under his breath, and a dim smile
pinched the corners of his lips as he stuck between them
the cork tip of a cigarette, the last one in the tin, and lifted
a lit match with slow tremulous deliberation.

he wore smart eye-glasses to shield them. His mouth, thinlipped,
would tighten in response to a line that suggested strength of
