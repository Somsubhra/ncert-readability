Crying

Read and enjoy

Crying only a little bit
is no use. You must cry
until your pillow is soaked!
Then you can jump in the shower
and splash-splash-splash!

58

Then you can throw open
your window
and, “Ha, ha! ha ha!”
And if people say, “Hey,
what's going on up there?”
“Ha ha!” sing back, “Happiness
was hiding in the last tear!
I wept it! Ha ha!”

Food for Thought
When you have something serious to think about then
you have food for thought.
Here's some FOOD FOR YOUR THOUGHT!

Tomatoes are red, beans are green
A brinjal has a crown, just like a queen.
Potatoes are brown, onions are pink
Carrots have juice, which I can drink.
Vegetables make me healthy and wise
So eat some daily with roti and rice.

SCENE 1

A hostel room. Two brothers, aged 9 and 14 years
sitting at a study table. The elder brother, Bhaiya,
is reading a book and the younger one, Munna, is
drawing pictures of birds and animals.

BHAIYA
MUNNA
BHAIYA

What are you doing, Munna?
I am drawing.
When will you study? Where were you in the
morning?
(turning pale) I was playing. Bhaiya, how can
you sit with a book for hours together?
That's because I want my foundation in
education to be very strong. If the base is
strong then the building will stand firmly.
Sometimes it takes me two years to do one
year's work.
Bhaiya, you are five years older than I am and
three classes ahead of me. I wonder why you
keep writing the same word twenty times, one
sentence more than twenty times and copy
poems several times in beautiful letters?
You know, studying English is no child's play,
one has to work very hard in order to learn the
subject. To speak or write English properly,
tremendous effort is required. But the moment
you get a chance, you run to the field, play
marbles and fly paper kites, or sit idling away
with friends for fun! Can’t you sit down and
study?

BHAIYA

Oh Bhaiya, there is a big mela in the village
today. Should we go?
Have you ever seen me going to a fair or going
to watch a cricket or hockey match? I don't go
near them. I prefer to study a book. I don't
mind repeating a class for more than two
years. But you might stay in the same class all
your life. Do you expect to pass if you waste
your time playing all the time? You are simply
wasting father's hard earned money.
(Munna starts crying on being scolded and
sobbing sounds wah, wah, bah, bah, hu, hu,
are heard)

MUNNA
BHAIYA

Bhaiya, I feel like running away and going
back home.
Now, now! Stop crying. Put on a nice smile.
Look I will make a timetable for you to follow.
Get up at dawn.

But when is the time to play?
Play? What is the need, Munna?
Oh! I love the green fields, the gentle breeze, I
want to jump up like a football, I like the touch
and go and hu tu tu sounds of the kabaddi, and
the hurry and flurry of volleyball pulls me like
a magnet. As soon as I am on the field, I forget
everything.

SCENE 2 The final exams are over and the results are out.

BHAIYA

Alas! I have failed once again.
Oh! But Bhaiya, I have passed and topped my
class. Now there is only two years difference
between us.
But my dear brother, don't be so proud.
You have passed only one class and you think
that I'm stupid and you are smart. Once in a
while, in a gulidanda game, you might get
lucky and hit a goal but that does not mean

Now, what would you do if I were to fall sick
today?
I don't know, Bhaiya! I would tell Baba and he
would rush to the hostel.
Aha! I had expected this answer. Now Baba
would not get upset. He would first try to find
out what was wrong and then he would call a
doctor. Baba would know exactly what to do.
They have more experience than us.
(with tears in his eyes) Bhaiya I am sorry, what
you say is true.
(Bhaiya hugs Munna lovingly)
I also like to play and fly kites. But if I also play

UNIT 4

Teacher's Page

Poem:Crying
Story: My Elder Brother

THEMES
Respecting elders and their experience
Looking at the lighter side of life
READING TIME
Teachers should encourage children to read classics in English as well as in any
other languages they know, to enhance their reading habit.
It is also important for children to understand that all poems need not rhyme. There
are also poems that are in blank verse though there is a basic rhythm to such poems.
This Unit presents a story of Premchand translated into English, setting forth
translation as a means of understanding other cultures.

CONVERSATION TIME
The teacher should view children's talk as a valuable resource. Conversing in small
groups can nurture the abilities to compare and contrast, to wonder and remember,
to guess and challenge, to judge and evaluate.
Children can be asked to enact different emotions like joy, anger, excitement,
sadness etc.
Children can discuss their interactions with parents and other elders and share the
reasons why sometimes they dislike being told what to do /not do.

WRITING TIME
The writing exercises, creative writing and the letter writing should be done
after a general discussion in class so that every child is clear about what has to
be written. E.g. the meanings of the feeling words should be clear to the
children. The use of the dictionary should be advised and encouraged
throughout.
PROJECT WORK
Through the medium of creative dramatics children can become whatever they
wish to be. Teachers can plan for experiences in dramatic expression
