Don’t be afraid of the dark, little one,
The earth must rest when the day is done.
The sun must be harsh, but moonlight – never!
And those stars will be shining forever and ever,

Be friends with the Night, there is nothing to fear,
Just let your thoughts travel to friends far and near.
By day, it does seem that our troubles won’t cease,
But at night, late at night, the world is at peace.
– Ruskin Bond

Don’t Give Up
If you keep on going
And never stop,
You can keep on going,
You can make it to the top.
Life is full of mountains,
Some are big and some are small,
But if you don’t give up
You can overcome them all.
So keep on going
Try not to stop,
When you keep on going
You can make it to the top.

Helen Keller
It was the summer of 1880. A healthy baby girl was born
in a small town in Alabama. Her parents loved her dearly
and named her Helen Keller. But one day, the baby
became ill and day after day, her fever stayed high.
Everyone in the family tried to help her to get better, but
all they could say was, “There is nothing more we can do.
The baby may not live.”
Helen lived. But she was not the same after her illness.
“Something is very wrong,” her mother said. At last they
found out what was wrong. The child could not see or hear.
The baby grew into a little girl. Her parents felt sorry for
her. Helen often cried and held on to her mother. “Give the
poor child what she wants,” her father would say.
Though Helen could not hear or see, she was a bright
little girl. Some people thought Helen could not learn
anything. Her mother did not agree. “Helen is very smart,”
she said and added, “the problem is, how can we reach
her? She is locked
up inside herself.”
Helen began to
grow wild. She
would not let
anyone comb her
hair. Her clothes

were always dirty. She was often angry. Sometimes she
even lay on the floor and kicked her feet.
Her parents thought that they should find a teacher
for her. Miss Sullivan, a young teacher agreed to help
Helen to learn to see the world. Miss Sullivan gave
Helen a doll. “D_O_L_L” spells
doll. She spelt the
word with her
fingers into
Helen’s hand.
She made the
letters with
special hand
signs.
Helen copied
her teacher and
spelt D_O_L_L
too, but she did not
understand what she was
doing. Helen liked Miss Sullivan. She was strict but
kind. She spelt a lot of words for Helen, on her hand,
day and night, to make Helen understand.
One day, her teacher made Helen put her hand into
running water. Then, she spelt W_A_T_E_R. Suddenly
Helen understood that W_A_T_E_R meant something
wet, running over her hand. She understood that words

THEMES
Respecting differences
People around us

Teacher's page

Poem : Don’t be Afraid of the Dark
Story: Helen Keller

This Unit is about sensitising children to the world around them, in terms of their
thoughts about fear of night, darkness etc. It is also about ‘differences’ in children which
emerge due to certain individual needs that may affect their learning styles.
Warm up

d
e

A blindfold game where simple, ‘catch-the-thief’, ‘follow-the-leader’ games, can be
initiated, to give children a sense of joy and participation in the process of developing
sensitivity towards others.
Opportunities need to be given to all children and their specific abilities need to be
recognised and appreciated. This includes children with disabilities, who may need
assistance or more time to complete tasks.

Reading time

1. By this Unit you can now involve the children in silent reading of the lessons before
you actually start reading aloud to them. Identify a few children who could initiate a
reading session for the others. The bottom line for this Unit should be how to involve
the entire class into reading, listening and answering queries.
2. A small classwise competition within the school can be initiated.
Sharing time

1. Involve the children in sharing what they have felt during warm up time.

2. A chart about difficulties that children have in terms of their fears, I don’t like,
I can’t do can be put up in the class.
The idea is not only to make children do things but also to hear and understand what they
feel they can’t do. This feedback will work to sensitise you with their individual needs.
Creative time

1. Emphasise on similar sounding words with different spellings e.g. bee/be, son/sun
and other words given in the text.
2. Rhyming words can also now be introduced and children can be encouraged to create
their own little poems using rhyming names in the class (names of children /name of
things in the classrooms) in alphabetical order. These can be put on a chart and
children can then make a class rhyme.
Language corner

o
n

1. The chart above can form the central point of the language corner.

2. Children can be subtly involved in making written presentations about their thoughts,
feeling and ideas about this Unit.
3. Assessment of the class based on reading, listening, writing can now start with each
child getting a feedback.
Environment

Issues related to the class, like using less paper should now be focused upon.
