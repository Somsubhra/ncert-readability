1. Note-making
NOTE-MAKING is an important study skill. It also helps us at work.
We need to draw the main points of the material we read as it is
difficult to remember large chunks of information. Let us begin
with an example.

Study the following passage carefully

Pheasants are shy, charming birds known for their brilliant
plumage. These beautiful birds occupy an important niche
in nature’s scheme of things. Of the 900 bird species and
155 families, the pheasants belong to the order Galliformes
and family Phasinidae. The Galliformes are known as game
birds and this includes, pheasants, partridges, quails,
grouse, francolins, turkeys and megapodes.
There are 51 species of pheasants in the world and these
are shown in the identification chart brought out by the
Environment Society of India (ESI). The purpose of this chart
is to create awareness among members of the school ecoclubs under the National Green Corps (NGC) of the Ministry
of Environment and Forests, Government of India.
Except for the Congo Peafowl, all the other pheasants
are from Asia. Scientists believe that all pheasants originated
from the Himalayas, and then scattered into Tibet, China,
Myanmar, South and South East Asian countries as well as
the Caucasus Mountains. The jungle fowl and the peafowl
spread to South India and Sri Lanka long before the early
settlers established themselves in the Indo-Gangetic plain.
About a third of all the pheasants in the world are found
in India. The male blue peafowl (the peacock) is the best
known member of the pheasant family and is India’s national
bird. It occupies a prominent place in India’s art, culture
and folklore.

STEP 5
Finally we go over the facts and number them again.
Read carefully the characteristics of good notes which are given
below.
1.

(i) Notes should be short. They should identify the main
point.
(ii) They list information in what is called ‘note form’.
(iii) They are written only in phrases; not sentences.

2.

(i) Information is logically divided and subdivided by the
use of figures/letters.
(ii) The divisions are made like this:
Main sections
:
1, 2, 3, etc.
Sub-sections
:
(i), (ii), (iii), etc.
Sub-sub-sections :
(a), (b), (c), etc.

3.

Another common method is the ‘decimal’ system.
Main sections
:
1, 2, 3, etc.
Sub-sections
:
1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.
Sub-sub-sections
:
1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.2.1,
1.2.2, etc.

4.

Abbreviations and symbols are freely used. Articles,
prepositions and conjunctions are omitted.

5.

Notes must make sense when they are read again otherwise
they will be of no use.

Now read the following text.

The energy stored in coal and petroleum originally came to
the earth from the sun. The bulk of the present-day supplies
was laid down some 200 to 600 million years ago, when
tropical conditions were widespread. Lush, swampy forests
produced huge trees; warm coastal seas swarmed with
microscopic forms of life. When these organisms died, much
of their tissue was recycled as it is today — through
scavenging and decay. But a significant amount of dead
plant and animal material was covered with mud, which
prevented complete decomposition.

NOTE-MAKING

93

With the passage of time, layer upon layer of the fine
sediment was deposited over the once-living material; the
sheer weight turned the sediments to rock. Sandwiched
between the layers, both coal and petroleum were produced
and preserved under pressure. Coal was formed mostly of
giant fern-like plants that have only small counterparts
today. Coal may still be forming here and there on earth,
but conditions are not right for the production of significant
quantities.
1. Underline the important words and phrases.
2. Write down points without fully expanded verbs, numbering
them as you do.
3. Combine related points.
4. Group related points.
5. Change the verbs to nouns and begin points with them.
6. Number the points.
