Foreword

tt

THE National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that
children's life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning
which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between
the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks
developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this
basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the
maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas.
We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the
direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the
National Policy of Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school
principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on
their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions.
We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children
generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on
to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis
of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and
sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is
possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning,
not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and
mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary
as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required
number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The
methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how
effective this supplementary reader proves for making children’s
life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or
boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of
curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at
different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and
the time available for teaching. The book attempts to enhance this
endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for
contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and
activities requiring hands-on experience.

About the Book

no

tt

THIS supplementary reader, based on the English syllabus for
Class XI, is prepared on the lines suggested by the National
Curriculum Framework for School Education, 2005.
For young adults, awareness of personal development and
growing independence begins at the higher secondary stage. It is
during this period that they seek to understand themselves and the
society in which they live. Literature plays an important role in
moulding young minds. The choice of stories and biographical
sketches in Snapshots by contemporary writers exposes learners to
the various narratives of life that the literatures of the world offer.
The stories deal with a range of human predicaments: moral
choices in adolescents, as in William Saroyan’s ‘The Summer of the
Beautiful White Horse’; the poignancy of personal loss and
reconciliation that follows war in Marga Minco’s ‘The Address’;
language and imperialism invading the rural setting in ‘Ranga’s
Marriage’ by Masti Venkatesha Iyengar; and professional
commitment in A.J. Cronin’s ‘Birth’, an excerpt from the novel The
Citadel. We also have J.B. Priestley’s play, ‘Mother’s Day’, an early
comment on the acceptance of (and rebellion against) the assumed
roles of men and women at home. Amitav Ghosh’s ‘The Ghat of the
Only World’, is a touching tribute to Aga Shahid Ali, a Kashmiri
poet who wrote in English, while Vikram Seth’s ‘The Tale of Melon
City’ is a humorous satire set in verse.
The language of these stories allows learners to read on their
own with only occasional support from the teacher or reference to
the dictionary. Learners should be encouraged to read the stories
at home and the themes, narrative patterns and stylistic features
including use of punctuation can be discussed in the classroom. It
is hoped that this gateway to extensive reading will help learners
imbibe language unconsciously.
