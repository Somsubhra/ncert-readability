...But I must return to the question: why is there a
difference in the patterns of creativity among the
practitioners in the arts and the practitioners in the
sciences? 1 shall not attempt to answer this question
directly; but I shall make an assortment of remarks which
may bear on the answer.
First, I should like to consider how scientists and poets
view one another. When one thinks of the attitude of poets
to science, one almost always thinks of Wordsworth and
Keats and their off-quoted lines
A fingering slave,
One that would peep and botanises
Upon his mother’s grave?

o
n

A reasoning self-suffering thing.
An intellectual AlI-in-AIl!

Sweet is the lore which Nature brings:
Our meddling intellect
Misshapes the beauteous forms of things:
We murder to dissect.
(Wordsworth)

Do not all charms fly
At the mere touch of cold philosophy?
There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:
We know her woof, her texture; she is given
In the dull catalogue of common things.
Philosophy will clip an Angel’s wings.
(Keats)

These lines, perhaps, find an echo in a statement of
Lowes Dickinson, “When Science arrives, it expels Literature”.
It is to be expected that one should find scientists
countering these views. Thus, Peter Medawar counters
Lowes Dickinson by

The case I shall find evidence for is that when literature
arrives, it expels science… The way things are at present,
it is simply no good pretending that science and literature
represent complementary and mutually sustaining
endeavours to reach a common goal. On the contrary,
where they might be expected to cooperate they compete.

It would not seem to me that one can go very far in
these matters by pointing accusing fingers at one another.
So, let me only say that the attitudes of Wordsworth and
Keats are by no means typical. A scientist should rather
consider the attitude of Shelley. Shelley is a scientist’s
poet. It is not an accident that the most discriminating
literary criticism of Shelley’s thought and work is by a
distinguished scientist, Desmond King-Hele. As King-Hele
has pointed out, “Shelley’s attitude to science emphasises
the surprising modern climate of thoughts in which he
chose to live and Shelley describes the mechanisms of
nature with a precision and a wealth of detail unparalleled
in English poetry”. And here is A.N. Whitehead’s testimony

o
n

Shelley’s attitude to Science was at the opposite pole to
that of Wordsworth. He loved it, and is never tired of
expressing in poetry the thoughts which it suggests. It
symbolises to him joy, and peace, and illumination…

I should like to read two examples from Shelley’s poetry
which support what has been said about him. The first
example is from his Cloud which ‘fuses together a creative
myth, a scientific monograph, and a gay picaresque tale of
cloud adventure’

Patterns of Creativity

I am the daughter of Earth and Water,
And the nursling of the Sky:
I pass through the pores of the ocean and the shores:
I change, but I cannot die.
For after the rain when never a stain
The pavilion of Heaven is bare,
And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams
Build up the blue dome of air,
I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,
And out of the caverns of rain,
Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,
I arise and unbuild it again.

The second example is from Prometheus Unbound, which
has been described by Herbert Read as “the greatest
expression ever given to humanity’s desire for intellectual
light and spiritual liberty”
The lightning is his slave, heaven’s utmost deep
Gives up her stars, and like a flock of sheep
They pass before his eye, are numbered, and roll on!
The tempest is his steed, he strides the air;
And the abyss shouts from her depth laid bare,
Heaven, hast thou secrets? Man unveils me: I have none.

Let me turn to a slightly different aspect of the matter.
What are we to make of the following confession of Charles
Darwin?
Up to the age of thirty, or beyond it, poetry of many kinds, such
as the works of Milton, Gray, Byron, Wordsworth, Coleridge and
Shelley gave me great pleasure; and even as a school boy I took
intense delight in Shakespeare, especially historical plays... I
have also said that formerly pictures gave me considerable,
and music very great, delight. But now, for many years, I cannot
endure to read a line of poetry; I have tried lately to read
Shakespeare and found it so intolerably dull that it nauseated
me. I have almost lost my taste for pictures or music... My mind
seems to have become a kind of machine for grinding general
laws out of large collections of facts but why this should have
caused the atrophy of that part of the brain alone on which the
higher tastes depend, I cannot conceive.

o
n

Or consider this: Faraday discovered the laws of
electromagnetic induction and his discoveries led him to

156

formulate concepts such as ‘lines of force’ and ‘fields of
force’ which were foreign to the then prevailing modes of
thought. They were, in fact, looked askance by many of his
contemporaries. But of Faraday’s ideas, Maxwell wrote with
prophetic discernment
The way in which Faraday made use of his idea of the
lines of force in coordinating the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction shows him to have been, in reality, a
mathematician of a very high order—one from whom the
mathematicians of the future may derive valuable and
fertile methods. We are probably ignorant even of the name
of the science which will be developed out of the materials
we are now collecting, when the great philosopher next
after Faraday makes his appearance.

And yet when Gladstone, then the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, interrupted Faraday in his description of his
work on electricity by the impatient inquiry, “But after all,
what use is it?” Faraday’s response was, “Why, Sir, there
is every probability that you will soon be able to tax it”.
And Faraday’s response has always been quoted most
approvingly.
It seems to me that to Darwin’s confession and to
Faraday’s response, what Shelley has said about the
cultivation of the sciences in his Defence of Poetry is apposite
The cultivation of those sciences which have enlarged the
limits of the empire of man over the external world, has,
for want of the poetical faculty, proportionally circumscribed
those of the internal world; and man, having enslaved the
elements, remains himself a slave.

Lest you think that Shelley is not sensitive to the role
of technology in moden society, let me quote what he has
said in that connection

o
n

Undoubtedly the promoters of utility, in this limited sense,
have their appointed office in society. They follow the
footstep of poets, and copy the sketches of their creations
into the book of common life. They make space and give
time.

Shelley’s A Defence of Poetry, from which I have just
quoted, is one of the most moving documents in all of
English literature. W.B. Yeats called it “the profoundest

Patterns of Creativity

essay on the foundation of poetry in the English language”.
The essay should be read in its entirety; but allow me to
read a selection
Poetry is the record of the best and happiest moments of
the happiest and the best minds. Poetry, thus, makes
immortal all that is best and most beautiful in the world; it
arrests the vanishing apparitions which haunt the
interlunations of life,..
Poetry is indeed something divine. It is at once the centre
and circumference of knowledge; it is that which
comprehends all science, and that to which all science
must be referred. It is, at the same time, the root and
blossom of all other systems of thought.
Poets are the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration;
the mirrors or the gigantic shadows which futurity casts
upon the present; the words which express what they
understand not; the trumpets which sing to battle, and
feel not what they inspire; the influence which is moved
not, but moves. Poets are the unacknowledged legislators
of the world.

On reading Shelley’s A Defence of Poetry, the question
insistently occurs why there is no similar A Defence of
Science written by a scientist of equal endowment. Perhaps
in raising the question I have, in part, suggested an answer
to the one I have repeatedly asked during the lecture.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

SUGGESTED READING

‘Literature and Science’ by Matthew Arnold.

Read and enjoy the excerpts from an interview given by
S.Chandrasekhar to Deccan Herald (23 January, 1994 issue).
QUESTION: You came to America in 1936. Do you think you
would have achieved what you did had you stayed back
in India?

CHANDRASEKHAR: In a narrow sense, the answer is NO. There
were better facilities for work here. I was also disconcerted
with science politics in India. I was very sensitive and I desired
the mental peace to do science the way I wanted.
Secondly, how can one evaluate scientific achievement?
It is not a personal accomplishment. I had many students
and collaborators. Science has to be an integrated effort.
Otherwise, it would be too narrow.
Q:

Who was your earliest mentor? And who influenced you
most in your career?

o
n
A:

I had no mentor. And nobody influenced me. I wrote my
thesis on my own. I have always been alone. This is not
criticism. It is the character of my work.

Q:

Do you recall your mother and her attitudes which may
have shaped yours?

A:

Yes, I recall a particular incident which revealed my
mother’s extraordinary awareness. I was hardly ten years
old, when she woke me up one morning and said, “Do you
know Ramanujam is dead? It has come in the newspaper.”
The very fact that she realised that Ramanujam’s death
was an important event showed her enlightenment in
these matters. Her attitudes did influence me a great deal.

Q:

Has your wife been a great support to you in your scientific
career?

A:

I have mentioned Lalitha in my book, Truth and Beauty.
My biographer, Kameswar Wali, has also written a whole
chapter on my wife. [Suddenly, with a smile] Do you know
the American press called that the best chapter?

Q:

Have you, at any point of time, regretted your decision to
leave the country of your birth?

A:

There is no point in regretting or being happy over
decisions you have made. I think it’s irrational to regret
the past anyway. You must reconcile yourself to the life
you have chosen and lived.

Q:

Do you enjoy teaching?

A:

I always integrated teaching with research. They support
each other.

Q:

What is it that makes Indians achieve more in this country
(America) than in India? Do you think it could be the
academic climate?

A:

I wouldn’t judge achievement by awards. The quality of
science in India is good too. But I remember in the 1930s
the great scientists of that country were in the universities.
But today it is not so. And, that is a loss.

Q:

Has your personal life been complete and happy?

A:

That you should ask Lalitha—may be I could have given
more. [Pause] I don’t believe that a scientist—a true
scientist—can ever have a complete personal life. [Pause
again] I sometimes wonder whether all that I did and
accomplished in my lifetime—was it really worth it?

Kameswar Wali later interpreted this comment as: “When
Chandra asks—Was it worth it? — he is not being negative.
It is just an awareness, another dimension of realisation
which dawns as one get older.
