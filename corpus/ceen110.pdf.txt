Camel (smiling): So I am, but people call me the Ship of the
Desert. I can walk across the desert even on a hot afternoon.
The sand burns but it doesn’t bother me.
Lion: I can’t believe it.

Camel: Can you walk across a desert?
Lion (blinking): No, I can’t, but I can run in the forest.
Camel (with disdain): Every animal can do that. I alone can
run on sand. I can run on sand at 25 kilometres an hour.
Lion (wonderingly): How can you do that?

Camel: Look at my feet. They are thick and padded. The hot
sun does not burn them.

Lion: My feet are padded too. Thorns don’t prick them and I
can run 80 kilometres an hour.

Camel: That is true. You can run 80 kilometres an hour in the
forest but can you run even a mile on the hot sand?

no

Lion: May be not but....

Camel (interrupting): And you can't live without water for a
week, can you?
Lion: No, I can’t. I need water everyday. But don’t tell me you
can do without water?

Camel: Yes, I can. There are no rivers or lakes in a desert. But
that does not bother me. I can drink 200 bottles of water at a
time.

Camel (proudly): Yes, I have a big stomach. I can store water
for a week. I can store food for two weeks even.
Lion (showing a lot of interest): Do you store food in your
stomach?

ed

Camel: No, I don’t. I store it in my hump. I eat a lot of food at
one time. Then I don’t need to eat for a fortnight.
Lion: That’s interesting. But what do you eat?
Camel: I eat leaves, but there are no trees in a desert.

Lion: What do you eat there?

Camel: There are thorny bushes in the desert. I eat the
thorns. The thorns don’t prick my thick tongue.
Lion: How funny!

Camel: Mr King of the Forest, please come with me to the
desert.

Lion: No, I’d better not. I can’t walk on burning sand, I can’t
store food and water and I can’t eat thorns. Good bye and
good luck, Mr Ship of the Desert.

l
Correct
l

pronunciation of the words listed in the text may be practised like

appropriate expressions and actions. Try to find other interesting plays for the
class to enact. Masks and costumes can be added for interest.
Songs like these can be created.
Gently laughs the donkey,

Sweetly chirps the birdie

At the break of day,

At the break of day

If you do not feed her

“He haw! He haw!”

“Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!”

How Creatures Move

While flies can crawl straight up a wall,
And seals can dive and swim.

The worm he wiggles all around,
The monkey swings by his tail,

And birds may hop upon the ground
Or spread their wings and sail.
But boys and girls

Have much more fun:
They leap and dance
And walk and run.
