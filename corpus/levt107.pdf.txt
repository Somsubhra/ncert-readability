All precautions have been taken to see to it that
the O-level German examination arranged in the
prison for Evans does not provide him with any
means of escape.

It was in early March when the
Secretary of the Examinations Board
received the call from Oxford Prison.
“It’s a slightly unusual request,
Governor, but I don’t see why we shouldn’t
try to help. Just the one fellow, you say?”

“That’s it. Chap called Evans. Started night classes in
O-level German last September. Says he’s dead keen to get
some sort of academic qualification.”
“Is he any good?”
“He was the only one in the class, so you can say he’s
had individual tuition all the time, really. Would have cost
him a packet if he’d been outside.”
“Well, let’s give him a chance, shall we?”
“That’s jolly kind of you. What exactly’s the procedure
now?”
“Oh, don’t worry about that. I’ll be sending you all the
forms and stuff. What’s his name, you say? Evans?”
“James Roderick Evans.” It sounded rather grand.
“Just one thing, Governor. He’s not a violent sort of
fellow, is he? I don’t want to know his criminal record or
anything like that, but — ”
“No. There’s no record of violence. Quite a pleasant
sort of chap, they tell me. Bit of a card, really. One of the
stars at the Christmas concert. Imitations, you know the
sort of thing: Mike Yarwood stuff. No, he’s just a congenital
kleptomaniac, that’s all.” The Governor was tempted to
add something else, but he thought better of it. He’d look
after that particular side of things himself.
“Presumably,” said the Secretary, “you can arrange a
room where — ”
“No problem. He’s in a cell on his own. If you’ve no
objections, he can sit the exam in there.”
“That’s fine.”
“And we could easily get one of the parsons from
St. Mary Mags to invigilate, if that’s — ”
“Fine, yes. They seem to have a lot of parsons there,
don’t they?” The two men chuckled good-naturedly, and
the Secretary had a final thought. “At least there’s one
thing. You shouldn’t have much trouble keeping him
incommunicado, should you?”
The Governor chuckled politely once more, reiterated
his thanks, and slowly cradled the phone.
Evans!

Evans Tries an O-Level

“Evans the Break” as the prison officers called him.
Thrice he’d escaped from prison, and but for the recent
wave of unrest in the maximum-security establishments
up north, he wouldn’t now be gracing the Governor’s
premises in Oxford; and the Governor was going to make
absolutely certain that he wouldn’t be disgracing them.
Not that Evans was a real burden: just a persistent, nagging
presence. He’d be all right in Oxford, though: the Governor
would see to that — would see to it personally. And besides,
there was just a possibility that Evans was genuinely
interested in O-level German. Just a slight possibility. Just
a very slight possibility. At 8.30 p.m. on Monday 7 June,
Evans’s German teacher shook him by the hand in the
heavily guarded Recreational Block, just across from D
Wing.
..
“Guten Gluck, Herr Evans.”
“Pardon?”
“I said, “Good luck”. Good luck for tomorrow.”
..
“Oh. Thanks, er, I mean, er, Danke Schon.”
“You haven’t a cat in hell’s chance of getting through,
of course, but — ”
“I may surprise everybody,” said Evans.
At 8.30 the following morning, Evans had a visitor.
Two visitors, in fact. He tucked his grubby string-vest into
his equally grubby trousers, and stood up from his bunk,
smiling cheerfully. “Mornin”, Mr Jackson. This is indeed
an honour.”
Jackson was the senior prison officer on D Wing, and
he and Evans had already become warm enemies. At
Jackson’s side stood Officer Stephens, a burly, surly-looking
man, only recently recruited to the profession.
Jackson nodded curtly. “And how’s our little Einstein
this morning, then?”
“Wasn’t ’e a mathematician, Mr Jackson?”
“I think ’e was a Jew, Mr. Jackson.”
Evans’s face was unshaven, and he wore a filthy-looking
red-and-white bobble hat upon his head. “Give me a chance,
Mr Jackson. I was just goin’ to shave when you bust in.”

“Which reminds me.” Jackson turned
his eyes on Stephens.
“Make sure you take his
razor out of the cell
when he’s finished
scraping that ugly mug
of his. Clear? One of
these days he’ll do us
all a favour and cut his
bloody throat.”
For a few seconds
Evans looked
thoughtfully at the
man standing ramrod
straight in front of
him, a string of Second World
War medals proudly paraded over
his left breast-pocket. “Mr
Jackson? Was it you who took my
nail-scissors away?” Evans had
always worried about his hands.
“And your nail-file, too.”
“Look!’ For a moment Evans’s eyes smouldered
dangerously, but Jackson was ready for him.
“Orders of the Governor, Evans.” He leaned forward
and leered, his voice dropping to a harsh, contemptuous
whisper. “You want to complain?”
Evans shrugged his shoulders lightly. The crisis was
over.
“You’ve got half an hour to smarten yourself up, Evans
— and take that bloody hat off!”
“Me ’at? Huh!” Evans put his right hand lovingly on
top of the filthy woollen, and smiled sadly. “D’you know,
Mr Jackson, it’s the only thing that’s ever brought me any
sort o’ luck in life. Kind o’ lucky charm, if you know what I
mean. And today I thought — well, with me exam and all
that...”
Buried somewhere in Jackson, was a tiny core of
compassion; and Evans knew it.

“Just this once, then, Shirley Temple.” (If there was
one thing that Jackson genuinely loathed about Evans it
was his long, wavy hair.) “And get shaving!”
At 8.45 the same morning the Reverend Stuart McLeery
left his bachelor flat in Broad Street and stepped out briskly
towards Carfax. The weatherman reported temperatures
considerably below the normal for early June, and a long
black overcoat and a shallow-crowned clerical hat provided
welcome protection from the steady drizzle which had set
in half an hour earlier and which now spattered the thick
lenses of his spectacles. In his right hand he was carrying
a small brown suitcase, which contained all that he would
need for his morning duties, including a sealed question
paper envelope, a yellow invigilation form, a special
“authentication” card from the Examinations Board, a paper
knife, a Bible (he was to speak to the Women’s Guild that
afternoon on the Book of Ruth), and a current copy of The
Church Times.
The two-hour examination was scheduled to start at
9.15 a.m.
Evans was lathering his face vigorously when Stephens
brought in two small square tables, and set them opposite
each other in the narrow space between the bunk on the
one side and on the other a distempered stone wall. Next,
Stephens brought in two hard chairs, the slightly less
battered of which he placed in front of the table which
stood nearer the cell door.
Jackson put in a brief final appearance. “Behave
yourself, laddy!”
Evans turned and nodded.
“And these” — (Jackson pointed to the pin-ups) — “off!”
Evans turned and nodded again. “I was goin’ to take
“em down anyway. A minister, isn’t ’e? The chap comin’ to
sit in, I mean.”
“And how did you know that?” asked Jackson quietly.
“Well, I ’ad to sign some forms, didn’t I? And I couldn’t
’elp — ”
Evans drew the razor carefully down his left cheek,
and left a neat swath in the white lather. “Can I ask you

something, Mr. Jackson? Why did they ’ave to bug me in
this cell?” He nodded his head vaguely to a point above the
door.
“Not a very neat job,” conceded Jackson.
“They’re not — they don’t honestly think I’m goin’ to
try to — ”
“They’re taking no chances, Evans. Nobody in his
senses would take any chance with you.”
“Who’s goin’ to listen in?”
“I’ll tell you who’s going to listen in, laddy. It’s the
Governor himself, see? He don’t trust you a bloody inch —
and nor do I. I’ll be watching you like a hawk, Evans, so
keep your nose clean. Clear?” He walked towards the door.
Evans nodded. He’d already thought of that, and
Number Two Handkerchief was lying ready on the bunk —
a neatly folded square of off-white linen.
“Just one more thing, Einstein.”
“Ya? Wha’s ‘at?”
“Good luck, old son.”
In the little lodge just inside the prison’s main gates,
the Reverend S. McLeery signed his name neatly in the
visitors’ book, and thence walked side by side with a silent
prison officer across the exercise yard to D Wing, where he
was greeted by Jackson. The Wing’s heavy outer door was
unlocked, and locked behind them, the heavy inner door
the same, and McLeery was handed into Stephens’s keeping.
“Get the razor?” murmured Jackson.
Stephens nodded.
“Well, keep your eyes skinned. Clear?”
Stephens nodded again; and McLeery, his feet clanging
up the iron stairs, followed his new guide, and finally stood
before a cell door, where Stephens opened the peep-hole
and looked through.
“That’s him, sir.”
Evans, facing the door, sat quietly at the farther of
the two tables, his whole attention riveted to a textbook of
elementary German grammar. Stephens took the key from
its ring, and the cell lock sprang back with a thudded,
metallic twang.

It was 9.10 a.m. when the Governor switched on the
receiver. He had instructed Jackson to tell Evans of the
temporary little precaution — that was only fair. (As if
Evans wouldn’t spot it!) But wasn’t it all a bit theatrical?
Schoolboyish, almost? How on earth was Evans going to
try anything on today? If he was so anxious to make another
break, why in heaven’s name hadn’t he tried it from the
Recreational Block? Much easier. But he hadn’t. And there
he was now — sitting in a locked cell, all the prison officers
on the alert, two more locked doors between his cell and
the yard, and a yard with a wall as high as a haystack.
Yes, Evans was as safe as houses...
Anyway, it wouldn’t be any trouble at all to have the
receiver turned on for the next couple of hours or so. It
wasn’t as if there was going to be anything to listen to,
was it? Amongst other things, an invigilator’s duty was to
ensure that the strictest silence was observed. But... but
still that little nagging doubt! Might Evans try to take
advantage of McLeery? Get him to smuggle in a chisel or
two, or a rope ladder, or —
The Governor sat up sharply. It was all very well getting
rid of any potential weapon that Evans could have used;
but what about McLeery? What if, quite unwittingly, the
innocent McLeery had brought in something himself? A
jack-knife, perhaps? And what if Evans held him hostage
with such a weapon?
The Governor reached for the phone. It was 9.12 a.m.
The examinee and the invigilator had already been
introduced by Stephens when Jackson came back and
shouted to McLeery through the cell door. “Can you come
outside a minute, sir? You too, Stephens.”
Jackson quickly explained the Governor’s worries, and
McLeery patiently held out his arms at shoulder level whilst
Jackson lightly frisked his clothes. “Something hard here,
sir.”
“Ma reading glasses,” replied McLeery, looking down
at the spectacle case.
Jackson quickly reassured him, and bending down on
the landing thumb-flicked the catches on the suitcase. He

picked up each envelope in turn, carefully passed his palms
along their surfaces — and seemed satisfied. He riffled
cursorily through a few pages of Holy Writ, and vaguely
shook The Church Times. All right, so far. But one of the
objects in McLeery’s suitcase was puzzling him sorely.
“Do you mind telling me why you’ve brought this, sir?”
He held up a smallish semi-inflated rubber ring, such as a
young child with a waist of about twelve inches might have
struggled into. “You thinking of going for a swim, sir?”
McLeery’s hitherto amiable demeanour was slightly
ruffled by this tasteless little pleasantry, and he answered
Jackson somewhat sourly. “If ye must know, I suffer from
haemorrhoids, and when I’m sitting down for any length o’
time —”
“Very sorry, sir. I didn’t mean to, er...” The
embarrassment was still reddening Jackson’s cheeks when
he found the paper-knife at the bottom of the case. “I think
I’d better keep this though, if you don’t mind, that is, sir.”
It was 9.18 a.m. before the Governor heard their voices
again, and it was clear that the examination was going to
be more than a little late in getting under way.
MCL EERY: “Ye’ve got a watch?”
“Yes, sir.”
EVANS:
MCLEERY: “I’ll be telling ye when to start,
and again when ye’ve five
minutes left. A’ right?”

“How am I suppose to concentrate on my exam...
with someone breathin’ down my neck? Christ!
Sorry, sir, I didn’t mean — ”

The Governor reached for the phone. “Jackson? Ah,
good. Get Stephens out of that cell, will you? I think we’re
perhaps overdoing things.”
“As you wish, sir.”
The Governor heard the exchanges in the cell, heard
the door clang once more, and heard McLeery announce
that the examination had begun at last.
It was 9.25 a.m.; and there was a great calm.
At 9.40 a.m. the Examinations Board rang through,
and the Assistant Secretary with special responsibility for
modern languages asked to speak to the Governor. The
examination had already started, no doubt? Ah, a quarter
of an hour ago. Yes. Well, there was a correction slip which
some fool had forgotten to place in the examination package.
Very brief. “Could the Governor please...?
“Yes, of course. I’ll put you straight through to
Mr Jackson in D Wing. Hold the line a minute.”
Was this the sort of thing the Governor had feared?
Was the phone call a fake? Some signal? Some secret
message...? But he could check on that immediately. He
dialled the number of the Examinations Board, but heard
only the staccato bleeps of a line engaged. But then the
line was engaged, wasn’t it? Yes. Not very intelligent, that...
Two minutes later he heard some whispered
communications in the cell, and then McLeery’s broad Scots
voice:
“Will ye please stop writing a wee while, Mr Evans,
and listen carefully. Candidates offering German, 021-1,
should note the following correction. ‘On page three, line

fifteen, the fourth word should read goldenen, not, goldene;
and the whole phrase will therefore read zum goldenen
..
..
Lowen, not zum goldene Lowen.’ I will repeat that...”
The Governor listened and smiled. He had taken
German in the sixth form himself, and he remembered all
about the agreements of adjectives. And so did McLeery,
by the sound of things, for the minister’s pronunciation
was most impressive. But what about Evans? He probably
didn’t know what an adjective was.
The phone rang again. The Magistrates’ Court. They
needed a prison van and a couple of prison officers. Remand
case. And within two minutes the Governor was wondering
whether that could be a hoax. He told himself not to be so
silly. His imagination was beginning to run riot.
Evans!
For the first quarter of an hour Stephens had dutifully
peered through the peep-hole at intervals of one minute or
so; and after that, every two minutes. At 10.45 a.m.
everything was still all right as he looked through the peephole once more. It took four or five seconds — no more.
What was the point? It was always more or less the same.
Evans, his pen between his lips, sat staring straight in
front of him towards the door, seeking — it seemed — some
sorely needed inspiration from somewhere. And opposite
him McLeery, seated slightly askew from the table now:
his face in semi-profile; his hair (as Stephens had noticed
earlier) amateurishly clipped pretty closely to the scalp;
his eyes behind the pebble lenses peering short-sightedly
at The Church Times; his right index finger hooked beneath
the narrow clerical collar; and the fingers of the left hand,
the nails meticulously manicured, slowly stroking the short
black beard.
At 10.50 a.m. the receiver crackled to life and the
Governor realised he’d almost forgotten Evans for a few
minutes.

Silence.
EVANS:

“There’s one on me bunk ’ere, sir.”

MCL EERY: “Be quick about it.”
Silence.
At 10.51 a.m. Stephens was more than a little surprised
to see a grey regulation blanket draped round Evans’s
shoulders, and he frowned slightly and looked at the
examinee more closely. But Evans, the pen still between
his teeth, was staring just as vacantly as before. Blankly
beneath a blanket... Should Stephens report the slight
irregularity? Anything at all fishy, hadn’t Jackson said?
He looked through the peep-hole once again, and even as
he did so Evans pulled the dirty blanket more closely to
himself. Was he planning a sudden batman leap to suffocate
McLeery in the blanket? Don’t be daft! There was never
any sun on this side of the prison; no heating, either, during
the summer months, and it could get quite chilly in some
of the cells. Stephens decided to revert to his earlier every
minute observation.
At 11.20 a.m. the receiver once more crackled across
the silence of the Governor’s office, and McLeery informed
Evans that only five minutes remained. The examination
was almost over now, but something still gnawed away
quietly in the Governor’s mind. He reached for the phone
once more.
At 11.22 a.m. Jackson shouted along the corridor to
Stephens. The Governor wanted to speak with him —
“Hurry, man!” Stephens picked up the phone apprehensively
and listened to the rapidly spoken orders. Stephens himself
was to accompany McLeery to the main prison gates.
Understood? Stephens personally was to make absolutely
sure that the door was locked on Evans after McLeery had
left the cell. Understood?
Understood.
At 11.25 a.m. the Governor heard the final exchanges.

MCLEERY: “Good... Mr Stephens!” (Very loud)

The Governor heard the door clang for the last
time. The examination was over.

“How did he get on, do you think?” asked Stephens as
he walked beside McLeery to the main gates.
“Och. I canna think he’s distinguished himself, I’m
afraid.” His Scots accent seemed broader than ever, and
his long black overcoat, reaching almost to his knees,
fostered the illusion that he had suddenly grown slimmer.
Stephens felt pleased that the Governor had asked
him, and not Jackson, to see McLeery off the premises,
and all in all the morning had gone pretty
well. But something stopped him from
making his way directly to the canteen
for a belated cup of coffee. He wanted to
take just one last look at Evans. It was
like a programme he’d seen on TV —
about a woman who could never really

twenty times to check the bolts.
He re-entered D Wing, made his way along to Evans’s
cell, and opened the peep-hole once more. Oh, no! CHRIST,
NO! There, sprawled back in Evans’s chair was a man (for
a semi second Stephens thought it must be Evans), a grey
regulation blanket slipping from his shoulders, the front of

o
n

his closely cropped, irregularly tufted hair awash with fierce
red blood which had dripped already through the small black
beard, and was even now spreading horribly over the white
clerical collar and down into the black clerical front.
Stephens shouted wildly for Jackson: and the words
appeared to penetrate the curtain of blood that veiled
McLeery’s ears, for the minister’s hand felt feebly for a
handkerchief from his pocket, and held it to his bleeding
head, the blood seeping slowly through the white linen. He
gave a long low moan, and tried to speak. But his voice
trailed away, and by the time Jackson had arrived and
despatched Stephens to ring the police and the ambulance,
the handkerchief was a sticky, squelchy wodge of cloth.
McLeery slowly raised himself, his face twisted tightly
with pain. “Dinna worry about the ambulance, man! I’m a’
right... I’m a’ right... Get the police! I know...I know where...
he...” He closed his eyes and another drip of blood splashed
like a huge red raindrop on the wooden floor. His hand felt
along the table, found the German question paper, and
grasped it tightly in his bloodstained hand. “Get the
Governor! I know... I know where Evans...”
Almost immediately sirens were sounding, prison
officers barked orders, puzzled prisoners pushed their way
along the corridors, doors were banged and bolted, and
phones were ringing everywhere. And within a minute
McLeery, with Jackson and Stephens supporting him on
either side, his face now streaked and caked with drying
blood, was greeted in the prison yard by the Governor,
perplexed and grim.
“We must get you to hospital immediately. I just don’t — ”
“Ye’ve called the police?”
“Yes, yes. They’re on their way. But — ”
“I’m a’ right. I’m a’ right. Look! Look here!” Awkwardly
he opened the German question paper and thrust it before
the Governor’s face. “It’s there! D’ye see what I mean?”
The Governor looked down and realised what McLeery
was trying to tell him. A photocopied sheet had been
carefully and cleverly superimposed over the last (originally
blank) page of the question paper.

“Ye see what they’ve done, Governor. Ye see...” His
voice trailed off again, as the Governor, dredging the layers
of long neglected learning, willed himself to translate the
German text before him:
Sie sollen dem schon verabredeten Plan genau folgen.
Der wichtige Zeitpunkt ist drei Minuten vor Ende des
Examens... “You must follow the plan already somethinged.
The vital point in time is three minutes before the end of
the examination but something something — something
something... Don’t hit him too hard — remember, he’s a
minister! And don’t overdo the Scots accent when...”
A fast-approaching siren wailed to its crescendo, the
great doors of the prison yard were pushed back, and a
white police car squealed to a jerky halt beside them.
Detective Superintendent Carter swung himself out of
the passenger seat and saluted the Governor. “What the
hell’s happening, sir?” And, turning to McLeery: “Christ!
Who’s hit him?”
But McLeery cut across whatever explanation the
Governor might have given. “Elsfield Way, officer! I know
where Evans...” He was breathing heavily, and leaned for
support against the side of the car, where the imprint of
his hand was left in tarnished crimson.
In bewilderment Carter looked to the Governor for
guidance. “What — ?”
“Take him with you, if you think he’ll be all right. He’s
the only one who seems to know what’s happening.”
Carter opened the back door and helped McLeery inside;
and within a few seconds the car leaped away in a spurt of
gravel.

“Elsfield Way”, McLeery had said; and there it was
staring up at the Governor from the last few lines of the
German text: “From Elsfield Way drive to the Headington
roundabout, where...” Yes, of course. The Examinations
Board was in Elsfield Way, and someone from the Board
must have been involved in the escape plan from the very
beginning: the question paper itself, the correction slip...
The Governor turned to Jackson and Stephens. “I don’t
need to tell you what’s happened, do I?” His voice sounded

“And which one of you two morons was

Don’t you realise — ” But what was the use? He had used
the telephone at that time, but only to try (unsuccessfully,
once more) to get through to the Examinations Board.
He shook his head in growing despair and turned on
the senior prison officer. “As for you, Jackson! How long have

something, Jackson. Your skull’s empty. Absolutely empty!”
It was Jackson who had spent two hours in Evans’s cell the
previous evening; and it was Jackson who had confidently
reported that there was nothing hidden away there — nothing
at all. And yet Evans had somehow managed to conceal not
only a false beard, a pair of spectacles, a dogcollar and all
the rest of his clerical paraphernalia, but also some sort of
weapon with which he’d given McLeery such a terrible blow
across the head. Aurrgh!
A prison van backed alongside, but the Governor made
no immediate move. He looked down again at the last line
of the German: “...to the Headington roundabout, where
you go straight over and make your way to...to Neugraben.”
“Neugraben”? Where on earth — ? “New” something.
“Newgrave”? Never heard of it: There was a “Wargrave”,
somewhere near Reading, but... No, it was probably a code
word, or — And then it hit him. Newbury! God, yes! Newbury
was a pretty big sort of place but —

He rapped out his orders to the driver. “St Aldates
Police Station, and step on it! Take Jackson and Stephens
here, and when you get there ask for Bell. Chief Inspector
Bell. Got that?”
He leaped the stairs to his office three at a time, got Bell
on the phone immediately, and put the facts before him.
“We’ll get him, sir,” said Bell. “We’ll get him, with a bit
o’luck.”
The Governor sat back, and lit a cigarette. Ye gods!
What a beautifully laid plan it had all been! What a clever
fellow Evans was! Careless leaving that question paper
behind; but then, they all made their mistakes somewhere
along the line. Well, almost all of them. And that’s why
very very shortly Mr clever-clever Evans would be back
inside doing his once more.
The phone on his desk erupted in a strident burst,
and Superintendent Carter informed him that McLeery had
spotted Evans driving off along Elsfield Way; they’d got the
number of the car all right and had given chase
immediately, but had lost him at the Headington
roundabout; he must have doubled back into the city.
“No,” said the Governor quietly. “No, he’s on his way to
Newbury.” He explained his reasons for believing so, and
left it at that. It was a police job now — not his. He was
just another good-for-a-giggle, gullible governor, that was
all.
“By the way, Carter. I hope you
managed to get McLeery to the hospital
all right?”
“Yes. He’s in the Radcliffe now.
Really groggy, he was, when we got to
the Examination offices, and they rang
for the ambulance from there.”

“McLeery, you say?”
“Yes. He’s a parson.”

“I don’t think there’s anyone — ”
“Yes, there is. You’ll find one of your ambulances picked
him up from Elsfield Way about — ”
“Oh, that. Yes, we sent an ambulance all right, but
when we got there, the fellow had gone. No one seemed to
know where he was. Just vanished! Not a sign — ”
But the Governor was no longer listening, and the
truth seemed to hit him with an almost physical impact
somewhere in the back of his neck.
A quarter of an hour later they found the Reverend
S. McLeery, securely bound and gagged, in his study in
Broad Street. He’d been there, he said, since 8.15 a.m.,
when two men had called and...
Enquiries in Newbury throughout the afternoon
produced nothing. Nothing at all. And by tea-time everyone
in the prison knew what had happened. It had not been
Evans, impersonating McLeery, who had walked out; it had
been Evans, impersonating McLeery, who had stayed in.
The fish and chips were delicious, and after a gentle
stroll round the centre of Chipping Norton, Evans decided
to return to the hotel and have an early night. A smart
new hat concealed the wreckage of his closely cropped hair,
and he kept it on as he walked up to the reception desk of
the Golden Lion. It would take a good while for his hair to
regain its former glories — but what the hell did that matter.
He was out again, wasn’t he? A bit of bad luck, that, when
Jackson had pinched his scissors, for it had meant a long
and tricky operation with his only razor blade the previous
night. Ah! But he’d had his good luck, too. Just think! If
Jackson had made him take his bobble
hat off! Phew! That really had been a
close call. Still, old Jackson wasn’t such
a bad fellow...
One of the worst things — funny,
really! — had been the beard. He’d

The receptionist wasn’t the same girl who’d booked
him in, but the change was definitely for the better. As he
collected his key, he gave her his best smile, told her he
wouldn’t be bothering with breakfast, ordered the Daily
Express, and asked for an early-morning call at 6.45 a.m.
Tomorrow was going to be another busy day.
He whistled softly to himself as he walked up the broad
stairs... He’d sort of liked the idea of being dressed up as a
minister dog collar and everything. Yes, it had been a jolly
good idea for “McLeery’ to wear two black fronts, two collars.
But that top collar! Phew! It had kept on slipping off the
back stud; and there’d been that one panicky moment when
“McLeery’ had only just got his hand up to his neck in time
to stop the collars springing apart before Stephens... Ah!
They’d got that little problem worked out all right, though:
a pen stuck in the mouth whenever the evil eye had
appeared at the peep-hole. Easy! But all that fiddling about
under the blanket with the black front and the stud at the
back of the collar — that had been far more difficult than
they’d ever bargained for... Everything else had gone
beautifully smoothly, though. In the car he’d found
everything they’d promised him: soap and water, clothes,
the map — yes, the map, of course. The Ordnance Survey
Map of Oxfordshire... He’d got some good friends; some
very clever friends. Christ, ah!
He unlocked his bedroom door and closed it quietly
behind him — and then stood frozen to the spot, like a
man who has just caught a glimpse of the Gorgon.
Sitting on the narrow bed was the very last man in
the world that Evans had expected — or wanted — to see.
“It’s not worth trying anything,” said the Governor
quietly, as Evans’s eyes darted desperately around the room.
“I’ve got men all round the place.” (Well, there were only
two, really: but Evans needn’t know that.) He let the words
sink in. “Women, too. Didn’t you think the blonde girl in
reception was rather sweet?”
Evans was visibly shaken. He sat down slowly in the only
chair the small room could offer, and held his head between
his hands. For several minutes there was utter silence.

Finally, he spoke. “It was that bloody correction slip, I
s’pose.”
“We-ell” (the Governor failed to mask the deep
satisfaction in his voice) “there are a few people who know
a little German.”
Slowly, very slowly, Evans relaxed. He was beaten —
and he knew it. He sat up at last, and managed to smile
ruefully. “You know, it wasn’t really a mistake. You see, we
‘adn’t been able to fix up any ‘otel, but we could’ve worked
that some other way. No. The really important thing was
for the phone to ring just before the exam finished — to get
everyone out of the way for a couple of minutes. So we ‘ad
to know exactly when the exam started, didn’t we?”

“And, like a fool, I presented you with that little piece
of information on a plate.”
“Well, somebody did. So, you see, sir, that correction
slip killed two little birds with a single stone, didn’t it?
The name of the ‘otel for me, and the exact time the exam
started for, er, for, er...”
The Governor nodded. “It’s a pretty common word.”
“Good job it is pretty common, sir, or I’d never ‘ave
known where to come to, would I?”
“Nice name, though: zum goldenen Lowen.”
“How did you know which Golden Lion it was? There’s
‘undreds of ‘em.”
“Same as you, Evans. Index number 313; Centre
number 271. Remember? Six figures? And if you take an
Ordnance Survey Map for Oxfordshire, you find that the
six-figure reference 313/271 lands you bang in the middle
of Chipping Norton.”
“Yea, you’re right. Huh! We’d ‘oped you’d run off to
Newbury.”
“We did.”
“Well, that’s something, I s’pose.”
“That question paper, Evans. Could you really
understand all that German? I could hardly — ”
“Nah! Course I couldn’t. I knew roughly what it was all
about, but we just ‘oped it’d throw a few spanners in the
works — you know, sort of muddle everybody a bit.’
The Governor stood up. “Tell me one thing before we
go. How on earth did you get all that blood to pour over
your head?”
Evans suddenly looked a little happier. “Clever, sir.
Very clever, that was — ‘ow to get a couple o’ pints of blood
into a cell, eh? When there’s none there to start off with,
and when, er, and when the “invigilator”, shall we say,
gets, searched before ‘e comes in. Yes, sir. You can well
ask about that, and I dunno if I ought to tell you. After all,
I might want to use that particular — ”
“Anything to do with a little rubber ring for piles,
perhaps?”
Evans grinned feebly. “Clever, though, wasn’t it?”

“Must have been a tricky job sticking a couple of pints
“Nah! You’ve got it wrong, sir. No problem about that.”
“No?”
“Nah! It’s the clotting, you see. That’s the big trouble.
We got the blood easy enough. Pig’s blood, it was — from
the slaughter’ouse in Kidlington. But to stop it clotting
you’ve got to mix yer actual blood” (Evans took a breath)
“with one tenth of its own volume of 3.8 per cent trisodium
citrate! Didn’t know that, did you, sir?”
The Governor shook his head in a token of reluctant
admiration. “We learn something new every day, they tell
me. Come on, m’lad.”
Evans made no show of resistance, and side by side
the two men walked slowly down the stairs.
“Tell me, Evans. How did you manage to plan all this
business? You’ve had no visitors — I’ve seen to that. You’ve
had no letters — ”
“I’ve got lots of friends, though.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Me German teacher, for a start.”
“You mean — ? But he was from the Technical College.”
“Was ‘e?’ Evans was almost enjoying it all now. “Ever
check up on ‘im, sir?”
“God Almighty! There’s far more going on than I — ”
“Always will be, sir.”
“Everything ready?” asked the Governor as they stood
by the reception desk.
“The van’s out the front, sir,” said the pretty blonde
receptionist. Evans winked at her; and she winked back
at him. It almost made his day.
A silent prison officer handcuffed the recaptured Evans,
and together the two men clambered awkwardly into the
back seat of the prison van.
“See you soon, Evans.” It was almost as if the Governor
were saying farewell to an old friend after a cocktail party.
“Cheerio, sir. I, er, I was just wonderin’. I know your
German’s pretty good, sir, but do you know any more o’
these modern languages?”
“Not very well. Why?”

Evans settled himself comfortably on the back seat,
and grinned happily. ‘Nothin’, really. I just ‘appened to
notice that you’ve got some O-level Italian classes comin’
up next September, that’s all.’
“Perhaps you won’t be with us next September, Evans.”
James Roderick Evans appeared to ponder the
Governor’s words deeply. “No. P’r’aps I won’t,” he said.
As the prison van turned right from Chipping Norton
on to the Oxford road, the hitherto silent prison officer
unlocked the handcuffs and leaned forward towards the
driver, “For Christ’s sake get a move on! It won’t take ‘em
long to find out —’
“Where do ye suggest we make for?” asked the driver,
in a broad Scots accent..
“What about Newbury?” suggested Evans.

2.

When Stephens comes back to the cell he jumps
to a conclusion and the whole machinery blindly
goes by his assumption without even checking
the identity of the injured ‘McLeery’. Does this
show how hasty conjectures can prevent one from
seeing the obvious? How is the criminal able to
predict such negligence?

3.

What could the Governor have done to securely
bring back Evans to prison when he caught him
at the Golden Lion? Does that final act of
foolishness really prove that “he was just another
good-for -a-giggle, gullible governor, that was all”?

4.

While we condemn the crime, we are sympathetic
to the criminal. Is this the reason why prison staff
often develop a soft corner for those in custody?

5.

Do you agree that between crime and punishment
it is mainly a battle of wits?
