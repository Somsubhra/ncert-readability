I had a Little Pony
I had a little pony,
His name was Dapple-grey,
I lent him to a lady,
To ride a mile away.
She whipped him, she lashed him,
She drove him through the mire.
I wouldn’t lend my pony now,
For all the lady’s hire.

The Milkman’s Cow
The milkman’s cow was in a bad mood. It sat in the middle
of the road and refused to move.
The milkman begged the cow to get up. “The children are
waiting for their milk to help them grow strong. Please get
up,” he pleaded. He pulled and tugged and prayed.
But the cow wasn’t going anywhere that day.
Along came a policeman, his buttons and
buckles gleaming bright. “Humph,” he said,
twirling his long
moustache, “I’ll
show you how
to do it right.”

Along came a grocer with bags of potatoes and
peas. He said, “I’ll move this cow with the greatest
of ease.”
The grocer, the policeman and the milkman
pulled and tugged and prayed.
But the cow wasn’t going anywhere that day.
Along came a wrestler, his muscles gleaming in
the sun. He said, “I have the strength of ten
horses, so this should be fun.”
The wrestler, the grocer, the policeman and the
milkman pulled and tugged and prayed.

The grocer clapped, the policeman twirled his
stick in joy.
The wrestler grinned. The ice-cream man
whooped at the cleverness of the boy.
The milkman happily clattered his pail.
Being kind and loving is best, for force and
strength can fail.

Unit 6
THEME
Caring for animals

Teacher's page

Poem : The Donkey
I had a Little Pony
Story: The Milkman’s Cow

This Unit deals with the fact that kindness can work better than violence, force, pressure or
anger. Children can also give examples about how they were angry at friends/parents/
siblings, but calmed down when gentler action was taken. The teacher can emphasise this
important value through other stories.
Warm up
The action of imitating insects and other tiny creatures as compared to big animals like the
elephant/cow can be done.
Reading time
Repeat
1. Children like to recite poetry together.
Choral speaking helps children improve
their speech, voice quality and pronunciation.
2. Reading in a small group with a
class leader
3. Reading from library books

1. Initiate word building and
emphasise on facts (true and false)

Sharing time
l
Give the groups time to talk about the pictures of the poem. Have short conversations
about the children’s own experiences. The story of the cow shows that a child may not be
able to do certain things but he can be clever enough to control a big animal like a cow.
Encourage children to speak about the special things they would like to do but cannot.
l
Sometimes ‘cannot’ can be turned into ‘can’. A child can stand on his head through the
practice of yoga. They may discuss other impossible situations for which solutions can be
found.
Creative time
Let the children make a list of the smaller creatures they see around the house and
l
garden. Another list of the large animals can also be drawn up. It can be pointed out that
all comparisons are relative and each creature has something special to share, give and
celebrate.
There can be other ways of showing kindness to animals besides offering food e.g.
l
petting, cuddling, tending to injuries, refraining from hitting or kicking, stopping others
from ill-treating and so on. Ask the children to write a few sentences about how they
showed kindness to an animal.

o
n

Language corner
Opposites, describing words and punctuation to be put on the language corner chart.
l
The opposites are given at the end of a sentence. Ask the children to make their own
l
sentences using the words can and cannot, fail and succeed, able and unable, and other
similar words.
Environment: Project – Save the trees in the school compound; weekly watering of trees;
clearing of weeds in the neighbourhood.
