Before you read

Ageing is a natural process; have you ever thought what our elderly
parents expect from us?

Driving from my parent’s
home to Cochin last Friday
morning, I saw my mother,
beside me,
doze, open mouthed, her face
ashen like that
of a corpse and realised with
pain
that she was as old as she
looked but soon
put that thought away, and
looked out at Young
Trees sprinting, the merry children spilling
out of their homes, but after the airport’s
security check, standing a few yards

away, I looked again at her, wan,
pale
as a late winter’s moon and felt that
old
familiar ache, my childhood’s fear,
but all I said was, see you soon,
Amma,
all I did was smile and smile and
smile......

sprinting : short fast race, running
wan : colourless

Think it out

1. What is the kind of pain and ache that the poet feels?
2. Why are the young trees described as ‘sprinting’?

3. Why has the poet brought in the image of the merry children
‘spilling out of their homes’?
4. Why has the mother been compared to the ‘late winter’s moon’?
5. What do the parting words of the poet and her smile signify?

Notice that the whole poem is in a single sentence, punctuated
by commas.
It indicates a single thread of thought interspersed with
observations of the real world around and the way these are
connected to the main idea.
