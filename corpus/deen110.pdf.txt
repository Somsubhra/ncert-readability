The Naughty Boy
There was a naughty boy,
And a naughty boy was he.
He ran away to Scotland,
The people there to see –
Then he found
That the ground
Was as hard,
That a yard
Was as long,
That a song
Was as merry,

That a cherry
Was as red,
That lead
Was as weighty,
That fourscore
Was as eighty,
That a door was as wooden
As in England—
So he stood in his shoes
And he wondered,
He wondered,
He stood in his shoes,
And he wondered.

Pinocchio
Once upon a time, an old carpenter bought a very
queer piece of wood. As he used his
plane on it, he heard a little
laughing voice say, “Stop!
You’re tickling me.”
The old man was
puzzled by the voice.
He said, “This
is a strange piece
of wood. What
shall I do with it?
I think. I’ll make
it into a puppet.”
He set to
work, and as
the puppet
boy took
shape, the old man said, “He must have a name.
I will call him Pinocchio.”
As soon as he finished making the eyes, the
carpenter was amazed to see them move.
Before the mouth was made, it began to laugh.
“Stop laughing!” the old man said.

It did stop,
but as soon as
his back was
turned, it put
out its tongue.
And its nose
grew long.
No sooner
were its hands
ready than it
snatched off
the carpenter’s wig and put it on its own head. And then
Pinocchio’s nose grew longer.
When its legs and feet were made, they were too stiff to
use, so the carpenter showed Pinocchio how to use them.
Now, the carpenter
decided to send
Pinocchio to
school. But
there, Pinocchio
did nothing but
look for fun. He
often ran away from
school.

go to school?” asked the carpenter. Pinocchio told
him a lie... and his nose started growing longer
and longer.
Each time he was rude to someone or told a
lie, his nose grew longer. Finally Pinocchio said,
“I’m glad to be a real boy. I’ll never lie again.”

Comprehension passage
Once a cunning jackal jumped into a big tub of blue dye.
“I am your king,” he said. All the animals, big and small
believed him and bowed before him. The clever jackal
smiled. Now he was the most powerful animal in the forest.
He was proud to be a king.
Once, the jackal woke up in the middle of the night. The
jackals in the forest were howling at the full moon in the
sky. The blue jackal forgot he was a king. He, too, began to
howl.
“Hu…aah! Hu…aah!” he cried.
The animals ran out to see. “He is not a king. He is just a
jackal!” they shouted. They rushed to attack him.
“Stop, stop! I am sorry I tricked you. Please do not kill
me!” said the blue jackal.
The animals forgave him, but only after giving the jackal
a good beating.

THEMES
The importance of art, craft
and creativity

Teacher's page

Poem : The Naughty Boy
Story: Pinocchio

By this Unit the children would have enriched their vocabulary through
telling, retelling and reading aloud of poems, stories, folk tales in English.
They would also use appropriate spoken and written language in meaningful
contents/situations. Give children opportunities to listen to sound/sound
techniques and appreciate the rhythm and music of rhymes – sounds.
Teachers in the entire country welcome puppets into the classroom, they
preserve traditions and make them a vital part of everyday learning. Puppets
can be used to explain, describe, direct, tell stories, ask questions and create
dramatic situations where children respond.

Puppets can provide children with many opportunities to expand language
skills and challenge their imaginations. Students can develop confidence
talking through the characters of puppets.
Transference of language one to language two will now be felt only if your
observation about each child in your group is relevant. We are giving you a
mere guideline to follow. This assessment should be more on the patterns of –
1. your observation of the child as an individual and as a team member in a
group.
2. determining the cause of the child’s school-related difficulties.
3. understanding her/his individual learning style.

4. consultation with parents/other teachers to review assessment
findings and determining an appropriate intervention plan.
