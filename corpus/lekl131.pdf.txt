A drama is a composition in prose or verse
presenting in dialogue a story of life or character,
especially one intended to be acted on the stage.
The essence of drama is the make-believe by which
an actor impersonates a character of the play. The
element of make-believe in drama is much greater
than the average play-goer realises. For instance,
we must regard it as entirely natural that rooms
and houses have one wall ‘missing’ that enables
the audience to witness the action.
Drama is usually divided into tragedy and comedy,
but within this general framework a number of
types and subtypes have been developed. The
tragicomedy, for instance, mixes elements of both
tragedy and comedy; the modern ‘problem-play’
deals with neither of these but with middle class
life and problems.
Furthermore, drama is the literary form most
viable with the modern mass media; and film, radio
and television are producing a vast quantity of it,
ranging from ‘soap opera’ and farce to serious new
works and fine productions of old ones.

Two plays find a place in the section: Chandalika
by Tagore which describes the angst of an
untouchable woman; and an excerpt from Broken
Images by Girish Karnad, which is a monologue
by a celebrity writer that plumbs the depths of her
psyche and r ecreates her life for the TV viewer.

Rabindranath Tagore was a poet, novelist, shortstory writer and dramatist. He was awarded the
Nobel Prize for Literature in 1931. Tagore’s interest
in drama was fostered while he was a boy, for
his family enjoyed writing and staging plays. The
music in his plays is instrumental in bringing out
the delicate display of emotion around an idea.
The central interest in his plays is the unfolding
Rabindranath Tagore of character; of the opening up of the soul to
1861-1941
enlightenment of some sort.

INTRODUCTION

This short drama is based on the following Buddhist legend.
Ananda, the famous disciple of the Buddha, was one day
returning from a visit when he felt thirsty and, approaching
a well on the way, asked for water from a chandalika, a
girl belonging to the lowest untouchable caste. The girl
gave him water and fell in love with the beautiful monk.
Unable to restrain herself, she made her mother, who knew
the art of magic, work her spell on him. The spell proved
stronger than Ananda’s will and the spell-bound monk
presented himself at their house at night; but, as he saw
the girl spread the couch for him, he was overcome with
shame and remorse and prayed inwardly to his master to
save him. The Buddha heard the prayer and broke the
magic spell and Ananda went away, as pure as he came.
This crude plot of the popular tale, showing how the
psychic power of the Buddha saves his devotee from the
lust of a chandal girl, has been transformed by the poet

o
n

d
e

205/CHANDALIKA

into a psychological drama of intense spiritual conflict. It
is not the story of a wicked girl roused to lust by the physical
beauty of the monk, but of a very sensitive girl, condemned
by her birth to a despised caste, who is suddenly awakened
to a consciousness of her full rights as a woman by the
humanity of a follower of the Buddha, who accepts water
from her hand and teaches her to judge herself not by the
artificial values that society attaches to the accidents of
birth, but by her capacity for love and service.
This is a great revelation for her, which she calls a
new birth; for she is washed clean of her self-degradation
and rises up a full human being with her right to love and
to give. And since her own self is the most she can give,
and since none is more worthy of the gift of her surrender
than the bhikshu who has redeemed, or, as she puts it,
created her, she yearns to offer herself to him. But Ananda,
detached from all earthly cares and immersed in his inner
self, knows nothing of all this and passes by without
recognising her.
She is humiliated, wounded in her newly awakened
sensibility, and determines to drag the monk from his pride
of renunciation to the abjectness of desire for her. She has
lost all religious scruple or fear, for she owed nothing to
religion save her humiliation.
‘A religion that insults is a false religion. Everyone
united to make me conform to a creed that blinds and
gags. But since that day something forbids me to conform
any longer. I’m afraid of nothing now.’
She forces her mother to exercise her art of magic on
Ananda. She refers to it as the primeval spell, the spell of
the earth, which is far more potent than the immature
sadhana of the monks. The ‘spell of the earth’ proves its
force and Ananda is dragged to their door, his face distorted
with agony and shame. Seeing her redeemer, so noble and
resplendent before, thus cruelly transformed and degraded,
she is horrified at the selfish and destructive nature of
her desire. The hero to whom she yearned to dedicate
herself was not this creature, blinded by lust and darkened
with shame, but Ananda of the radiant form, who had

given her the gift of a new birth and had revealed her own
true humanity. In remorse she curses herself and falls at
his feet, begging for forgiveness. The mother revokes the
spell and willingly pays the price of such revocation, which
is death. The chandalika is thus redeemed for the second
time, purged of the pride and egoism that had made her
forget that love does not claim possession, but gives
freedom.
Chandalika is a tragedy of self-consciousness overreaching its limit. Self-consciousness, up to a point, is
necessary to self-development; for, without an awareness of
the dignity of one’s own role or function, one cannot give
one’s best to the world. Without rights there can be no
obligations, and service and virtue when forced become marks
of slavery. But self-consciousness, like good wine, easily
intoxicates, and it is difficult to control the dose and have
just enough of it. Vanity and pride get the upper hand and he
who clings to his rights very often trespasses on those of
others. This is what happened to the heroine. Prakriti, in her
eagerness to give, forgot that Ananda need not take; her
devotion grew so passionate that she could not make her
surrender without first possessing. Yet it was inevitable that
it should be so; for a new consciousness, after ages of
suppression, is overpowering and one learns restraint only
after suffering. Hence the tragedy. The good mother who, so
unwillingly, worked the spell to please her importunate
daughter, and who so willingly revoked it to save Ananda,
dies in the process. The daughter, though chastened and
made wise by suffering, has paid a heavy price; for wisdom is
not happiness and renunciation is not fulfilment.

PRAKRITI. Here, mother, here I am.
MOTHER. Where?
PRAKRITI. Here, by the well.
MOTHER. Whatever will you do next? Past noon, and a
blistering sun, and the earth too hot for the feet! The
morning’s water was drawn long ago, and the other
girls in the village have all taken their pots home.
Why, the very crows on the amloki branches are
gasping for heat. Yet you sit and roast in the Vaisakh
sun for no reason at all! There’s a story in the Purana
about how Uma left home and did penance in the
burning sun—is that what you are about?
PRAKRITI. Yes, mother, that’s it—I’m doing penance.
MOTHER. Good heavens! And for whom?
PRAKRITI. For someone whose call has come to me.
MOTHER. What call is that?
PRAKRITI. ‘Give me water.’ He set the words echoing in my
heart.
MOTHER. Heaven defend us! He said to you ‘Give me
water’? Who was it? Someone of our own caste?
PRAKRITI. That’s what he said—that he belonged to our
kind.
MOTHER. You didn’t hide your caste? Did you tell him
that you are a chandalini?
PRAKRITI. I told him, yes. He said it wasn’t true. If the
black clouds of Sravana are dubbed chandal, he said,
what of it? It doesn’t change their nature, or destroy
the virtue of their water. Don’t humiliate yourself, he
said; self-humiliation is a sin, worse than self-murder.
MOTHER. What words are these from you? Have you
remembered some tale of a former birth?
PRAKRITI. No, this is a tale of my new birth.
MOTHER. You make me laugh. New birth, indeed! Since
when, pray?
PRAKRITI. It was the other day. The palace gong had just
struck noon and it was blazing hot. I was washing
that calf at the well—the one whose mother died. Then

208/K ALEIDOSCOPE

a Buddhist monk came and stood before me, in his
yellow robes, and said, ‘Give me water’. My heart
leaped with wonder. I started up trembling and bowed
before his feet, without touching them. His form was
radiant as with the light of dawn. I said, ‘I am a
chandalini, and the well-water is unclean’. He said,
‘As I am a human being, so also are you, and all water
is clean and holy that cools our heat and satisfies our
thirst’. For the first time in my life I heard such words,
for the first time I poured water into his cupped
hands—the hands of a man the very dust of whose
feet I would never have dared to touch.
MOTHER. O, you stupid girl, how could you be so reckless?
There will be a price to pay for this madness! Don’t
you know what caste you were born in?
PRAKRITI. Only once did he cup his hands, to take the
water from mine. Such a little water, yet that water
grew to a fathomless, boundless sea. In it flowed all
the seven seas in one, and my caste was drowned,
and my birth washed clean.
MOTHER. Why, even the way you speak is changed. He
has laid your tongue under a spell. Do you understand
yourself what you are saying?
PRAKRITI. Was there no other water, mother, in all Sravasti
city? Why did he come to this well of all wells? I may
truly call it my new birth! He came to give me the
honour of quenching Man’s thirst. That was the mighty
act of merit which he sought. Nowhere else could he
have found the water which could fulfill his holy vow—
no, not in any sacred stream. He said that Janaki
bathed in such water as this, at the beginning of her
forest exile, and that Guhak, the chandal, drew it for
her. My heart has been dancing ever since, and night
and day I hear those solemn tones— ‘Give me water,
give me water’.
MOTHER. I don’t know what to make of it, child; I don’t
like it. I don’t understand the magic of their spells.
Today I don’t recognise your speech; tomorrow,
perhaps, I shall not even recognise your face. Their
spells can make a changeling of the very soul itself.

PRAKRITI. All these days you have never really known me,
mother. He who has recognised me will reveal me.
And so I wait and watch. The midday gong booms
from the palace, the girls take up their water-pots
and go home, the kite soars alone into the far sky,
and I bring my pitcher and sit here at the well by the
wayside.
MOTHER. For whom do you wait?
PRAKRITI. For the wayfarer.
MOTHER. What wayfarer will come to you, you crazy girl?
PRAKRITI. That one wayfarer, mother, the one and only. In
him are all who fare along the ways of all the world.
Day after day goes by, yet he does not come. Though
he spoke no word, his word was given—why does he
not keep his word? For my heart is become like a
waterless waste, where the heat-haze quivers all day
long. Its water cannot be given, for no one comes to
seek it.
MOTHER. I can make nothing of your talk today; it’s as
though you were intoxicated. Tell me plainly, what do
you want?
PRAKRITI. I want him. All unlooked for—he came, and
taught me this marvellous truth, that even my service
will count with the God who guides the world. O words
of great wonder! That I may serve, I, a flower sprung
from a poison-plant! Let him raise that truth, that
flower from the dust, and take it to his bosom.
MOTHER. Be warned, Prakriti, these men’s words are meant
only to be heard, not to be practised. The filth into
which an evil fate has cast you is a wall of mud that
no spade in the world can break through. You are
unclean; beware of tainting the outside world with
your unclean presence. See that you keep to your own
place, narrow as it is. To stray anywhere beyond its
limits is to trespass.

Blessed am I, says the flower, who belong to the
earth.
For I serve you, my God, in this my lowly home.
Make me forget that I am born of dust,
For my spirit is free from it.
When you bend your eyes upon me my petals
tremble in joy;
Give me a touch of your feet and make me heavenly,
For the earth must offer its worship through me.

MOTHER. Child, I’m beginning to understand something
of what you say. You are a woman; by serving you
must worship, and by serving you must rule. Women
alone can in a moment overstep the bounds of caste;
when once the curtains of destiny are drawn aside,
they all stand revealed in their queenliness. You had
a good chance, you know, when the king’s son was
deer-hunting and came to this very well of yours. You
remember, don’t you?
PRAKRITI. Yes, I remember.
MOTHER. Why didn’t you go to the king’s house? He had
forgotten everything in your beauty.
PRAKRITI. Yes, he had forgotten everything—forgotten that
I was a human being. He had gone out hunting beasts;
he saw nothing but the beast whom he wanted to
bind in chains of gold.
MOTHER. At least he noticed your beauty, if only as game
to be hunted. As for the Bhikshu, does he see the
woman in you?
PRAKRITI. You won’t understand, mother, you won’t! I feel
that in all these days he is the first who ever really
recognised me. That is a marvellous thing. I want
him, mother, I want him beyond all measure. I want
to take this life of mine and lay it like a basket of
flowers at his feet. It will not defile them. Let everyone
marvel at my daring! I shall glory in my claim. ‘I am
your handmaid,’ I shall declare—for otherwise I must
lie bound for ever at the whole world’s feet, a slave!

o
n

211/CHANDALIKA

MOTHER. Why do you get so excited, child? You were born
a slave. It’s the writ of Destiny, who can undo it?
PRAKRITI. Fie, fie, Mother, I tell you again, don’t delude
yourself with this self-humiliation—it is false, and a
sin. Plenty of slaves are born of royal blood, but I am
no slave; plenty of chandals are born of Brahmin
families, but I am no chandal.
MOTHER. I don’t know how to answer you, child. Very
good. I’ll go to him myself, and cling to his feet. ‘You
accept food from every home’, I’ll say. ‘Come to our
house too, and accept from our hands at least a bowl
of water.’
PRAKRITI. No, no, I’ll not call him in that way, from outside.
I’ll send my call into his soul, for him to hear. I am
longing to give myself; it is like a pain at my heart.
Who is going to accept the gift? Who will join with me
in give-and-take? Will he not mingle his longings with
mine, as the Ganges mingles with the black waters of
the Jumna? For music springs up of itself, and he
who came unbidden has left behind him a word of
hope. What is the use of one pitcher of water when
the earth is cracked with drought? Will not the clouds
come of themselves to fill the whole sky, the rain seek
the soil by its own weight?
MOTHER. What is the use of such talk? If the clouds come,
they come: if they don’t, they don’t; if the crops wither,
it’s no concern of theirs! What more can we do than
sit and watch the sky?
PRAKRITI. That won’t do for me; I won’t simply sit and
watch. You know how to work spells; let those spells
be the clasp of my arms, let them drag him here.
MOTHER. What are you saying, wretched girl? Is there no
limit to your recklessness? It would be playing with
fire! Are these bhikshus like ordinary folk? How am I
to work spells on them? I shudder even to think of it.
PRAKRITI. You would have worked them boldly enough on
the king’s son.
MOTHER. I’m not afraid of the king; he might have had me
impaled, perhaps. But these men—they do nothing.

PRAKRITI. I fear nothing any longer, except to sink back
again, to forget myself again, to enter again the house
of darkness. That would be worse than death! Bring
him here you must! I speak so boldly, of such great
matters—isn’t that in itself a wonder? Who worked
the wonder but he? Shall there not be further wonders?
Shall he not come to my side, and sit with me on the
corner of my cloth?
MOTHER. Suppose I can bring him, are you ready to pay
the price? Nothing will be left to you.
PRAKRITI. No, nothing will be left. The burden and heritage
of birth after birth—nothing will remain. Only let me
bring it all to an end, then I shall live indeed. That’s
why I need him. Nothing will be left me. I have waited
for age after age, and now in this birth my life shall
be fulfilled. My mind is saying it over and over again—
fulfilled! It was for this that I heard those wonderful
words, ‘Give me water’. Today I know that even I can
give. Everyone else had hidden the truth from me. I
sit and watch for his coming today to give, to give, to
give everything I have.
MOTHER. Have you no respect for religion?
PRAKRITI. How can I say? I respect him who respects me.
A religion that insults is a false religion. Everyone
united to make me conform to a creed that blinds and
gags. But since that day something forbids me to
conform any longer. I’m afraid of nothing now. Chant
your spells, bring the Bhikshu to the side of the
chandalini. I myself shall do him honour—no one else
can honour him so well.
MOTHER. Aren’t you afraid of bringing a curse upon
yourself?
PRAKRITI. There has been a curse upon me all my life.
Poison kills poison, they say—so one curse another.
Not another word, mother, not another word. Begin
your spells, I cannot bear any more delay.
MOTHER. Very well, then. What is his name?
PRAKRITI. His name is Ananda.
MOTHER. Ananda? The disciple of the Lord Buddha?
PRAKRITI. Yes, it is he.

MOTHER. O my heart’s treasure, you are the apple of my
eye—but it’s a great wrong I’m putting my hand to at
your bidding!
PRAKRITI. What wrong? I will bring to my side the one who
brings all near. What crime is there in that?
MOTHER. They draw men by the strength of their virtue.
We drag them with spells, as beasts are dragged in a
noose. We only churn up the mud.
PRAKRITI. So much the better. Without the churning, how
can the well be cleansed?
MOTHER (apostrophising Ananda].
O thou exalted one, thy power to forgive is greater far
than my power to offend. I am about to do thee
dishonour, yet I bow before thee: accept my obeisance,
Lord.
PRAKRITI. What are you afraid of, mother? Yours are the
lips I use, but it’s I who chant the spells. If my longing
can draw him here, and if that is a crime, then I will
commit the crime. I care nothing for a code which
holds only punishment, and no comfort.
MOTHER. You are immensely daring, Prakriti.
PRAKRITI. You call me daring? Think of the might of his
daring! How simply he spoke the words which no one
had ever dared to say to me before! ‘Give me water.’
Such little words, yet as mighty as flame—they filled
all my days with light, they rolled away the black
stone whose weight so long had stopped the fountains
of my heart, and the joy bubbled forth. Your fear is an
illusion, for you did not see him. All morning he had
begged alms in Sravasti city; when his task was done
he came, across the common, past the burning-ground,
along the river bank, with the hot sun on his head—
and all for what? To say that one word, ‘Give me water’,
even to a girl like me. O, it is too wonderful! Whence
did such grace, such love, come down—upon a wretch
unworthy beyond all others? What can I fear now?
‘Give me water’—yes, the water which has filled all
my days to overflowing, which I must needs give or
die! ‘Give me water.’ In a moment I knew that I had

water, inexhaustible water; to whom should I tell my
joy? And so I call him night and day. If he does not
hear, fear not; chant your spell, he will be able to
bear it.
MOTHER. Look, Prakriti, some men in yellow robes are
going by the road across the common.

PRAKRITI. O Mother, see, he is going, there ahead of them
all. He never turned his head or looked towards this
well. He could so easily have said ‘Give me water’
once more before he went. I thought he would never
be able to cast me aside—me, his own handiwork, his
new creation. [She flings herself down and beats her
head on the ground.] This dust, this dust is your place!
O wretched woman, who raised you to bloom for a
moment in the light? Fallen in the end into this same
dust, you must mingle for all time with this same
dust, trampled underfoot by all who travel the road.

call it a dream? A dream, is it, that sinks its sharp

its grip? And they, who have no ties, no joy or sorrow,
no earthly burden, who float along like the clouds in
autumn—are only they awake, are only they real?
MOTHER. O Prakriti, I cannot bear to see you suffer so.
Come, get up, I will chant the spells, I will bring
him. All along the dusty road I will bring him. ‘I
want nothing,’ he says in his pride. I’ll break that
pride and make him come, running and crying ‘I
want, I want’.
PRAKRITI. Mother, yours is an ancient spell, as old as life
itself. Their mantras are raw things of yesterday.
These men can never be a match for you—the knot
of their mantras will be loosened under the stress of
your spells. He is bound to be defeated.
MOTHER. Where are they going?
PRAKRITI. Going? They are going nowhere! During the rains
they remain four months in penance and fasting,
and then they are off again, how should I know
where? That’s what they call being awake!
MOTHER. Then why are you talking of spells, you crazy
thing? He is going so far—how am I to bring him
back?
PRAKRITI. No matter where he goes, you must bring him
back. Distance is nothing for your spells. He showed
no pity to me, I shall show none to him. Chant your
spell, your cruellest spells; wind them about his
mind till every coil bites deep. Wherever he goes, he
shall never escape me!
MOTHER. You need not fear, it is not beyond our powers. I
will give you this magic mirror; you shall take it in
your hand and dance. His shadow will fall on the
glass, and in it you will see what happens to him
and how near he has come.

the lightning flash, the waves foam high in an ocean
whose shore I cannot see.
MOTHER. Think well even now, lest sudden terror spring
upon you with the work half done. Can you endure
to the end? When the spell has reached its height, it
would cost me my life to undo it. Remember that
this fire will not die down till all that will burn is
burnt to ashes.

Nothing will hurt him. Let him come, let him tread

My mortal pain will I offer as gift at thy feet.

MOTHER. I never knew it would take so long. My spells
have no more power, child; there is no breath left in
my body.
PRAKRITI. Don’t be afraid, mother; hold out a little longer,
only a little. It will not be long now.
MOTHER. The month of Ashad is here, and their four
months’ fast is at hand.
PRAKRITl. They are gone to Vaisali, to the monastery there.
MOTHER. How pitiless you are! That is so far away.
PRAKRITI. Not very far; seven days’ journey. Fifteen days
have already passed. His seat of meditation has been
shaken at last. He is coming, he is coming! All that
once lay so far away, so many million miles away,
beyond the very sun and moon, immeasurably beyond
the reach of my arms—it is coming, nearer and
nearer! He is coming, and my heart is rocked as by
an earthquake.
MOTHER. I have worked the spell through all its stages—
such force might have brought down Indra of the
thunderbolt himself. And yet he does not come. It is
a fight to the death indeed. What did you see in the
mirror?
PRAKRITI. At first I saw a mist covering the whole sky,
deathly pale like the weary gods after their struggle
with the demons, Through rifts in the mist there

o
n

glimmered fire. After that the mist gathered itself
up into red and angry clusters, like swollen, festering
sores. That day passed. The next day I looked, and
all the background was a deep black cloud, with
lightning playing across it. Before it he was standing,
all his limbs fenced with flame. My blood ran cold,
and I rushed to tell you to stop your spells at once—
but I found you in deep trace, sitting like a log,
breathing hardly, and unconscious. It seemed as
though a fierce fire burned in you, and your fire was
a flaming serpent that hissed and struck in deadly
duel at the fire that wrapped him round. I came
back and took up the mirror; the light was gone—
only torment, unfathomable torment, was in his face.
MOTHER. Yet that did not kill you? The fire of his suffering
burnt into my soul, till I thought I could bear no more.
PRAKRITI. It seemed that the tortured form I saw was not
his only, but mine too; it belonged to us both. In
those awful fires the gold and the copper had been
melted and fused.
MOTHER. And you felt no fear?
PRAKRITI. Something far greater than fear. I beheld the
God of Creation, more terrible far than the God of
Destruction, lashing the flames to work His purposes,
while they writhed and roared in anger. What lay at
his feet in the casket of the seven elements—Life or
Death? My mind swelled with a joy hard to name—
joy in the tremendous detachment of new creation,
free of care or fear, of pity or sorrow. Creation
breaking, burning and melting among the sparks of
the elemental fires. I could not keep still. My whole
soul and body danced and danced together, as the
pointed flames dance in the fire.
MOTHER. And how did your Bhikshu appear?
PRAKRITI. His eyes were fixed motionless upon the
distance, like stars in the evening twilight. I longed
to escape from myself far into boundless space.
MOTHER. When you danced before the mirror, he saw you?
PRAKRITI. Fie upon it, how I am shamed! Again and again
his eyes grew red, as though he were about to curse.

Again and again he trampled down the glowing fires
of anger, and at last his anger turned upon himself,
quivering, like a spear, and pierced his own breast.
MOTHER. And you bore all this?
PRAKRITI. I was amazed. I, this I, this daughter of yours,
this nobody from nowhere—his suffering and mine
are one today! What holy fire of creation could have
wrought such a union? Who could dream of so great
a thing?
MOTHER. When shall his turmoil be stilled?
PRAKRITl. When my suffering is stilled. How can he attain
his mukti until I attain mine?
MOTHER. When did you last look into your mirror?
PRAKRITl. Yesterday evening. He had passed through the
lion-gate of Vaisali some days before, at dead of
night—seemingly in secret, unknown to the monks.
After that I had sometimes seen him ferried across
rivers or on difficult mountain passes. I had seen
the evening fall, and him alone on the wide commons,
or on the dark forest paths at dead of night. As the
days went by, he fell more deeply under the spell
and became heedless of everything, all the conflict
with his own soul at an end. His face was mazed,
his body slack, his eyes fixed in an unseeing stare,
as though for him there were neither true nor false,
good nor evil—only a blind and thoughtless
compulsion, with no meaning in it.
MOTHER. Can you guess how far he has come today?
PRAKRITI. I saw him yesterday at Patal village on the river
Upali. The river was turbulent with new rains; there
was an old peepul tree by the ghat, fireflies shining
in its branches, and under it a lichened altar. As he
reached it he gave a sudden start and stood still. It
was a place he had known for a long time; I have
heard that one day the Lord Buddha preached there
to King Suprabhas. He sat down and covered his
eyes with his hands—I felt that his dream-spell
might break at any moment. I flung away the mirror,
for I was afraid of what I might see. The whole day
has passed since then, and torn between hope and

fear I have sat on, not daring to know. Now it is dark
again; on the road goes the watchman calling the
hour, it must be an hour past midnight. O mother,
the time is short, so short; don’t let this night be
wasted; put the whole of your strength into the spell.
MOTHER. Child, I can do no more; the spell is weakening,
I am failing body and soul.
PRAKRITl. It mustn’t weaken now—don’t give up now!
Maybe he has turned his face away, maybe the chain
we have bound on him is stretched to the uttermost,
and will not hold. What if he escapes now, away
from this birth of mine, and I can never reach him
again? Then it will be my turn to dream, to return to
the illusion of a chandal birth. I will never endure
that mockery again. I beseech you, mother, put out
your whole strength once only; set in motion your
spell of the primeval earth, and shake the complacent
heaven of the virtuous.
MOTHER. Have you made ready as I told you?
PRAKRITI. Yes. Yesterday was the second night of the
waxing moon. I bathed in the river Gambhira,
plunging below the water. Here in the courtyard I
drew a circle, with rice and pomegranate blossoms,
vermilion and the seven jewels. I planted the flags
of yellow cloth, I placed sandal-paste and garlands
on a brass tray, I lit the lamps. After my bath I put
on a cloth, green like the tender rice shoots, and a
scarf like the champak flower. I sat with my face to
the East. All night long I have contemplated his
image. On my left arm I have tied the bracelet of
thread—sixteen strands of golden yellow bound in
sixteen knots.
MOTHER. Then dance round the circle in your dance of
invocation, while I work my spells before the altar.
[Prakriti dances and sings.]
Now, Prakriti, take your mirror and look. See, a dark
shadow has fallen over the altar. My heart is bursting
and I can do no more. Look into the mirror—how
long will it be now?

PRAKRITl. No, I will not look again, I will listen—listen in
my inmost being. If he reveals himself I shall see
him before me. Bear up a little longer, mother, he
will surely, surely reveal himself. Hark! Hark to the
sudden storm, the storm of his coming! The earth
quivers beneath his tread, and my heart throbs.
MOTHER. It brings a curse for you, unhappy girl. As for
me, it means surely death—the fibres of my being
are shattered.
PRAKRITI. No curse, it brings no curse, it brings the gift of
my new birth. The thunderbolt hammers open the
Lion-gates of Death; the door breaks, the walls
crumble, the falsehood of this birth of mine is
shattered. Tr emors of fear shake my mind, but
rhythms of joy enrapture my soul. My All-destroyer,
my All-in-all, you have come! I will enthrone you on
the summit of all my dishonour, and build your royal
seat of my shame, my fear and my joy.
MOTHER. My time is near, I can do no more. Look in the
mirror at once.
PRAKRITI. Mother, I’m afraid. His journey is almost at an
end, and what then? What then for him? Only myself,
my wretched self? Nothing else? Only this to repay
the long and cruel pain? Nothing but me? Only this
at the end of the weary, difficult road?—only me?
MOTHER. Have pity, cruel girl, I can bear no more. Look
in the mirror, quick!
PRAKRITI (looks in the mirror and flings it away). O mother,
mother, stop! Undo the spell now—at once—undo it!
What have you done? What have you done? O
wicked, wicked deed!—better have died. What a sight
to see! Where is the light and radiance, the shining
purity, the heavenly glow? How worn, how faded,
has he come to my door! Bearing his self’s defeat as
a heavy burden, he comes with drooping head... Away
with all this, away with it! [She kicks the
paraphernalia of magic to pieces.] Prakriti, Prakriti,
if in truth you are no chandalini, offer no insult to
the heroic. Victory, victory to him!

[Enter Ananda.]
O Lord, you have come to give me deliverance,
therefore have you known this torment. Forgive me,
forgive me. Let your feet spurn afar the endless
reproach of my birth. I have dragged you down to
earth, how else could you raise me to your heaven?
O pure one, the dust has soiled your feet, but they
have not been soiled in vain. The veil of my illusion
shall fall upon them, and wipe away the dust.
Victory, victory to thee, O Lord!
MOTHER. Victory to thee, O Lord. My sins and my life lie
together at thy feet, and my days end here, in the
haven of thy forgiveness. [She dies.]

ANANDA [chanting].

Buddho Susuddho karuna mahannvo
Yoccanta suddhabbara-gnana locano
Lokassa papupakilesa ghatako
Vandami Buddham ahamadarena tam.

To the most pure Buddha, mighty ocean of mercy,
Seer of knowledge absolute, pure, supreme,
Of the world’s sin and suffering the Destroyer—
Solemnly to the Buddha I bow in homage.

Thinking about the Play
1.

o
n
2.
3.

d
e

Why does something so ordinary and commonplace as giving
water to a wayfarer become so significant to Prakriti?

Why is the girl named Prakriti in the play? What are the images
in the play that relate to this theme?

How does the churning of emotions bring about self-realisation
in Prakriti even if at the cost of her mother’s life?

4.

How does the mirror reflect the turmoil experienced by the monk
as a result of the working of the spell?

5.

What is the role of the mother in Prakriti’s self-realisation?
What are her hopes and fears for her daughter?

223/CHANDALIKA

6.

‘Acceptance of one’s fate is easy. Questioning the imbalance of
the human social order is tumultuous.’ Discuss with reference
to the play.

Appreciation
1.

How does the dramatic technique suit the theme of the play?

2.

By focusing attention on the consciousness of an outcast girl,
the play sensitises the viewer/reader to the injustice of
distinctions based on the accidents of human birth. Discuss
how individual conflict is highlighted against the backdrop of
social reality.

‘I will enthrone you on the summit of all my dishonour, and build
your royal seat of my shame, my fear and my joy’. Pick out more
such examples of the interplay of opposites from the text. What
does this device succeed in conveying?

‘Shadow, mist, storm’ on the one hand, ‘flames, fire,’ on the
other. Comment on the effect of these and similar images of
contrast on the viewer/reader.
