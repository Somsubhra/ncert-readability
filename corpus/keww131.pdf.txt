ESSAYS

INTRODUCTION

An essay is a short composition in prose that undertakes
to discuss a matter, express a point of view, or persuade
us to accept an idea on any subject. It is addressed to a
general rather than a specialised audience; as a
consequence, the essay discusses its subject in a nontechnical fashion and often with a liberal use of anecdote,
illustration and humour.
A useful distinction is that between the formal and informal
essay. The formal essay is relatively impersonal, logically
organised and filled with serious purpose. The informal
essay is personal, written in a relaxed, often whimsical
fashion, and tends to deal with everyday things.
Essays have been written since ancient times. The French
writer, Montaigne, wrote short literary pieces which he
called Essaies, meaning ‘attempts’. Francis Bacon
inaugurated the English use of the term in his own essays.
The founding of literary periodicals and magazines gave
great impetus to the writing of essays (earlier essays were
published in books).
The essays in this unit provide a wide thematic range. My
Watch is a humorous re-look at an instrument that most of
us take for granted. My Three Passions focuses on the
eternal concepts of love and pity. Tribal Verse makes one
sensitively aware of the rich oral literatures of India.
Bridges, an autobiographical excerpt, gives us a glimpse
into the life of a kathak dancer and choreographer while
Patterns of Creativity throws light on the creativity of poetry
and creativity of science.

My beautiful new watch had run eighteen months without
losing or gaining, and without breaking any part of its
machinery or stopping. I had come to believe it infallible in
its judgments about the time of day, and to consider its
constitution and its anatomy imperishable. But, at last,
one night, I let it run down. I grieved about it as if it were a
recognised messenger and forerunner of calamity. But by
and by I cheered up, set the watch by guess, and commanded
my bodings and superstitions to depart.
Next day I stepped into the chief jeweller’s to set it by
the exact time, and the head of the establishment took it
out of my hand and proceeded
to set it for me. Then he said,
‘she is four minutes slow—
regulator wants pushing up’. I
tried to stop him—tried to make
him understand that the watch
kept perfect time. But no; all
this human cabbage could see
was that the watch was four
minutes slow and the regulator
must be pushed up a little; and
so, while I danced around him

in anguish, and implored him to let the watch alone, he
calmly and cruelly did the shameful deed. My watch began
to gain. It gained faster and faster day by day. Within a
week it sickened to a raging fever and its pulse went up to
a hundred and fifty in the shade. At the end of two months
it had left all the timepieces of the town far in the rear and
was a fraction over thirteen days ahead of the almanac. It
was away into November enjoying the snow, while the
October leaves were still turning. It hurried up house rent,
bills payable and such things in such a ruinous way that I
could not abide it. I took it to the watchmaker to be
regulated. He asked me if I had ever had it repaired. I said
no, it had never needed any repairing. He looked a look of
vicious happiness and eagerly pried the watch open, and
then put a small dice-box into his eye and peered into its
machinery. He said it wanted cleaning and oiling, besides
regulating, and asked me to come in a week. After being
cleaned and oiled, and regulated, my watch slowed down
to that degree that it ticked all appointments I go to, missing
my dinner, I gradually drifted back into yesterday, then
the day before, then into last week and by and by the
comprehension came upon me that, all solitary and alone,
I was lingering alone in week before last and the world was
out of sight. I seemed to detect in myself a sort of sneaking
fellow-feeling for the mummy in the museum, and a desire
to swap news with him. I went to a watchmaker again. He
took the watch all to pieces while I waited and then said
the barrel was ‘swelled’. He said he could reduce it in three
days. After this the watch averaged well, but nothing more.
For a half day it would go like the very mischief, and keep
up such a barking and wheezing and whooping and sneezing
and snorting that I could not hear myself think for the
disturbance: and as it held out there was not a watch in
the land that stood any chance against it. But the rest of
the day it would keep on slowing down and fooling along
until all the clocks it had left behind caught up again. It
would show a fair and square average, and no man could
say it had done more or less than its duty.

But a correct average is only a mild virtue in a watch
and I took this instrument to another watchmaker. He said
the king-bolt was broken. I said I was glad it was nothing
more serious. To tell the plain truth, I had no idea what
the king-bolt was, but I did not choose to appear ignorant
to a stranger. He repaired the king-bolt but what the watch
gained in one way it lost in another. It would run a while
and then stop a while, and then run a while again, and so
on, using its own discretion about the intervals. And every
time it went off it kicked back like a musket. I padded my
breast for a few days but, finally, took the watch to another
watchmaker. He picked it all to pieces and turned the ruin
over and over under his glass; and then he said there
appeared to be fresh start. It did well now, except that
always at ten minutes to ten the hands would shut together
like a pair of scissors and from that time forth they would
travel together. The oldest man in the world could not make
head or tail of the time of day by such a watch, and so I
went again to have the thing repaired. This person said
that the crystal had got bent and the mainspring was not
straight. He made these things all right and then my
timepiece performed unexceptionably, save that now and
then, after working along quietly for nearly eight hours,
everything inside would let go all of a sudden and begin to
buzz like a bee, and the hands would straightway begin to
spin round and round so fast that their individuality was
lost completely, and they simply seemed a delicate spider’s
web over the face of the watch. She would reel off the next
twenty-four hours in six or seven minutes, and then stop
with a bang. I went with a heavy heart to one more
watchmaker, and looked on while he took her to pieces.
Then I prepared to cross-question him rigidly, for this thing
was getting serious. The watch had cost two hundred dollars
originally, and I seemed to have paid out two or three
thousand for repairs. While I waited and looked on, I
presently recognised in this watchmaker an old
acquaintance—a steam-boat engineer of other days and
not a good engineer, either. He examined all the parts

carefully, just as the other watchmakers had done, and
then delivered his verdict with the same confidence of
manner.
He said:
‘She makes too much steam— you want to hang the
monkey-wrench on the safety-valve!’ I brained him on the
spot and had him buried at my own expense. My uncle
William (now deceased, alas!) used to say that a good horse
was a good horse until it had run away once, and that a
good watch was a good watch until the repairers got a chance
at it. And he used to wonder what became of all the
unsuccessful tinkers, and gunsmiths, and shoe-makers, and
engineers, and blacksmiths; but nobody could ever tell him.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Samuel L. Clemens (1835–1910), who used the
pseudonym Mark Twain, was an American
humorist, short story writer and novelist.
Brought up in the small town of Hannibal,
Missouri, Mark Twain had less than 10 years of
schooling. He worked as a printer’s apprentice, a steamboat
pilot, a prospector and a journalist. All this gave him varied
experiences and a wide knowledge of humanity.
In the Adventures of Tom Sawyer, he drew on his own
childhood; The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which was
planned merely as a sequel, went on to become a
masterpiece, the story being narrated through an
uneducated boy.
