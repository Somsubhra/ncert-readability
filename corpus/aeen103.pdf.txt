One little kitten
Two big cats
Three baby butterflies
Four big rats
Five fat fishes
Six sad seals
Seven silly seagulls
Eight happy eels;
Nine nervous lizards
Ten brave bees
Eleven smelly elephants
Twelve fat fleas
Thirteen alligators
Fourteen whales
Fifteen donkeys
With fifteen tails.

Teacher's Pages

While working with the children provide them with activities that are
interesting and challenging. Give opportunities for fun to the children and
encourage early writing attempts. Help them to develop the skill to identify
and discriminate objects, pictures, colours, shapes etc.
Develop listening skills
4
Recite the poem to the children using appropriate actions/gestures.
Read the story with emphasis on new words and make sentences with
reference to the story.
Develop pronunciation
4

Exposure to language

Use sight words in the classroom such as visuals and cue cards. Let the
children read these:

Develop speaking skills
4
The little play on chicks can introduce vocabulary in an interesting,
conversational way.
1. Have a talk on eating healthy food.
2. Conversation based on ‘Role play’
l
Divide the class into four groups Red , Yellow , Blue , Green
Group Red: to make paper bags.
Group Blue: to collect leaves for eyes, nose, ears.
Group Yellow: to roll a string/play dough for whiskers.
Group Green: to roll a rope/twigs to make tails.
All groups will join to complete the
MATERIAL REQUIRED
paper bags. The children can decorate
them with animal faces or figures.
Afterwards these can be used as hand

you may want.

Imagine you are eating a fruit and it falls down. Ask the children
l
what they would do.
l
Act out a situation when (i) you are hungry (ii) you are full (iii) you
overeat.
4
Develop writing skills / fine motor coordination
1. Write the words hat, bed, pin, hot, cut and numbers 11 to 20 on the
blackboard. Let the child write numbers and read from the board.
Use Activity Sheets to further encourage the patterns as on pages
31, 33 and 37 and numbers 11 to 20 (here co-ordinate with the
maths teacher). However, do not force the child.
2. Sorting things into groups is an essential part of learning. By
differentiating between objects, children start to think about
similarities and differences and how things can be categorised.
Show children how to sort leaves and twigs by placing them in two
different piles.
3. Give children coloured beads and ask them to string them in a
sequence. For example, one blue bead, two red beads and so on. Or
on a string, thread two or three beads and ask the children the
number of beads.
4
Raising awareness
Tell the children to wash their hands before and after meals.
