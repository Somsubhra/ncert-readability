MANY VOICES

RADHA

My favourite activity is climbing trees. Just outside
our house, there is a guava tree which I love to go
up. Its branches spread out, so it is simple to climb
up the tree, and I can sit comfortably in the fork of
two branches. My
mother tells me it is
not sensible for girls
to climb trees, but
one afternoon she
climbed up too, and
both of us sat there
talking and eating
raw mangoes. When
I am high up in the
tree, I feel like I can
rule the whole world.

When I grow up, I
want to become a
seed collector. We
have cotton fields in
our village and every
year, my father
spends a lot of
money on buying new
seeds to grow our
cotton plants. My grandfather told me that
many years ago, he could collect the seeds
from his own plants which could be sown to
grow new plants during the next year. But
today that doesn't work so we have to spend
money to buy new seeds every single year. I
want to find out why that is so. I want to learn
how to preserve seeds so that we can use them
again and not spend money every year.

If I had a huge
amount of money I
would travel and
travel. I want to see
the mountains of
New Zealand because
they looked beautiful
in a magazine picture.
I wish I could sail down
the Amazon river in
South America on a
raft. I want to live on

the beaches of Lakshadweep and dive
down to see coral. I suppose I should
go to the Konark temple in Orissa or the
old city in Beijing in China and the
Pyramids in Egypt too, but what I
actually enjoy is seeing nature more
than old buildings.

SERBJIT
What makes me
very angry is when
people don’t believe
me when I am
telling the truth.
For example, if I
tell my teacher that
I couldn’t do my
homework because
Ravi borrowed my
book and forgot to
return it. Or I tell
my parents that it
w a s n ’t m e b u t
my little brother
who started the
fight. Or if I tell my teacher that I
really did study for the test even if I
have got bad marks. They all look at
me as if they think I am telling lies.
The look on their faces really angers
me. Sometimes I have to look down at
my shoes and count to ten so that I do
not show that I am angry.

When I grow up, I am
going to be the Prime
Minister of India. People
always laugh when I say
that, but I am sure that I
will do it. Everyone in my
class asks me what to do
when they have a
problem, and my teacher
always trusts me when something needs
to be done in school. I want to make things
better for everyone. I want us to have good
hospitals and roads and schools. I want to
make sure that there are many good
scientists in India who will invent cures
for diseases and send a spaceship to Mars.

My favourite day is
the second Sunday of
every month. On this
day our whole family
always goes to the
cinema hall to see a
film. My father gets
the tickets in advance
and all of us — my
grandmother, my
parents, my two
brothers and I — take
the bus there. In the
interval my father

The Wonderful Words
Imagine a world without language. All humans speak at least
one language. The words we speak bring out our thoughts. Read
the following poem on words.

Never let a thought shrivel and die
For want of a way to say it
For English is a wonderful game
And all of you can play it.
All that you do is match the words
To the brightest thoughts in your head
So that they come out clear and true
And handsomely groomed and fed—
For many of the loveliest things
Have never yet been said.
