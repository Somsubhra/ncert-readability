LETTER-WRITING

5. Letter-writing
L ETTER - WRITING is an important channel of communication
between people who are geographically distant from one
another. In earlier times when the telephone and e-mail were
not available, the only means of communication between people
was through letters.
Letter-writing is a skill that has to be developed. In general
there are two types of letters: formal, that are written to convey
official business and information and informal, which are
personal letters to communicate with friends and family. Formal
letters are sent out when we need to write to various public
bodies or agencies for our requirements in civic life. For example,
we might have to ask for a certificate or to inform a change in
our address. A letter is usually one in a series of exchanges
between two people or parties.
Formal Letters
Let us now examine some of the steps in writing formal letters.
1.

(i) Introducing oneself if it is the first time you are writing
(ii) Referring to an earlier letter if you are responding to it.

2. Stating the purpose of the letter
3.

(i) Stating action/information required from the addressee
(ii) Explaining action taken/supplying information

4.

(i) Urging action to be taken
(ii) Offering assistance in future

This is the basic structure of a letter. It will have to be
modified according to the purpose for which it is written and
the person to whom it is addressed.

When you write a letter you should keep in mind the following points.
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Purpose
Person to whom it is addressed
Tone you should adopt
Completeness of the message
Action required
Conciseness of expression

We have so far considered the content of letters. A letter also
has a typical format.
1. Name and address of sender
Companies have printed letterheads with the name of the
company printed on them. A letterhead may also carry the
name and designation of persons in responsible positions.
2. Name and address of addressee
3. Date
4. Mode of address or salutation
Salutation is the mode of addressing a person. We may have
the following forms.
(i) Dear Sir/Madam (when we are writing to a total stranger
whom we do not know at all).
(ii)

Dear Mr/Ms/Dr/Professor + Surname as in: Dear Dr
Sinha, (when it is a formal relationship with the
addressee and the writer does not know him or her
personally).

(iii)

Dear Sujata (when the writer knows the addressee
personally and the two share a semi-formal relationship).

5. Reference to previous correspondence, if any.
Most official letters carry a subject line just above the
salutation. This is for quick reference to the subject.
6. Content of letter
The content of the letter begins on the next line and is
arranged in two or three paragraphs.
7. Complimentary close and signature
Letters usually end politely with the following phrases:
Thank you, With regards, With best wishes, Hope to see

you soon, Hope to receive an early reply etc. The
complimentary close is followed by ‘Yours sincerely/ Yours
truly’, and the writer’s signature in the next line.
Given below is an example of the format of a formal letter.

Nowadays all the parts of a letter are aligned on the left. This
style is called the Full-Block style.

The date and signature are very important in letters.
We do not use commas after every line in the address.

HORNBILL

z

Do not begin your letters with hackneyed expressions like,
‘With reference to your letter dated 10 January’. Instead,
use personalised variations like, ‘I was glad to receive your
letter of 10 January…’ or ‘We were happy to note from your
letter that the goods have reached you safely…
’

z

Never end your letters with hanging participles like ‘Thanking
you’ or ‘Awaiting your reply’. Instead write, ‘Thank you’ or
‘We/I await/look forward to your reply’.

Informal Letters
Informal letters include personal letters. If it is a personal letter
the format is flexible. We might just write the name of our city on
top, followed by the date.

Hyderabad
12 November 2005
Dear Sujata,

All the best/Take care etc.

The flexible format of the informal letter may also be used to
seek information from concerned authorities. Given below is
an example.

To address someone whose name you do not know you
can write: Dear Sir, Dear Madam, Dear Sirs, Dear Sir/Madam.
To address someone by name, use their title and surname
e.g. Dear Dr Balakrishnan.
To end a letter, use ‘Yours sincerely’, if you have addressed
the person by name; ‘Yours faithfully’, if you have begun
the letter with ‘Dear Sir’ or ‘Madam’, etc.
