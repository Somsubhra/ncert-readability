1. P ATRICK never did homework. “Too
boring,” he said. He played hockey and
basketball and Nintendo instead. His
teachers told him, “Patrick! Do your
homework or you won’t learn a thing.”
And it’s true, sometimes he did feel like
an ignoramus. But what could he do?
He hated homework.
2.
Then one day he found his cat
playing with a little doll and he grabbed
it away. To his surprise it wasn’t a doll

Nintendo: a
video game

ignoramus: an

at all, but a man of the tiniest size. He
had a little wool shirt with oldfashioned britches and a high tall hat
much like a witch’s. He yelled, “Save me!
Don’t give me back to that cat. I’ll grant
you a wish, I promise you that.”
3.
Patrick couldn’t believe how lucky he
was! Here was the answer to all of his
problems. So he said, “Only if you do all
my homework till the end of the
semester, that’s 35 days. If you do a
good enough job, I could even get A’s.”
4.
The little man’s face wrinkled like a
dishcloth thrown in the hamper. He
kicked his legs and doubled his fists
and he grimaced and scowled and
pursed his lips, “Oh, am I cursed! But
I’ll do it.”

spells it, for fun,
to rhyme with
the word ‘witch’s’.

WHO DID PATRICK'S HOMEWORK?

And true to his word, that little elf
began to do Patrick’s homework. Except
there was one glitch. The elf didn’t
always know what to do and he needed
help. “Help me! Help me!” he’d say. And
Patrick would have to help — in
whatever way.
“I don’t know this word,” the elf
squeaked while reading Patrick’s
homework. “Get me a dictionary. No,
what’s even better, look up the word and
sound it out by each letter.”
6.
When it came to maths, Patrick was
out of luck. “What are times tables?” the
elf shrieked. “We elves never need that.

And addition and subtraction and
division and fractions? Here, sit down
beside me, you simply must guide me.”
Elves know nothing of human history,
to them it’s a mystery. So the little elf,
already a shouter, just got louder. “Go
to the library, I need books. More and
more books. And you can help me
read them too.”
7.
As a matter of fact, every day in every
way that little elf was a nag! Patrick was
working harder than ever and was it a
drag! He was staying up nights, had
never felt so weary, was going to school
with his eyes puffed and bleary.
8.
Finally, the last day of school arrived
and the elf was free to go. As for
homework, there was no more, so he
quietly and slyly slipped out the back door.
9.
Patrick got his A’s; his classmates
were amazed; his teachers smiled and
were full of praise. And his parents?
They wondered what had happened to
Patrick. He was now the model kid.
Cleaned his room, did his chores, was
cheerful, never rude, like he had
developed a whole new attitude.
10.
You see, in the end, Patrick still
thought he’d made that tiny man do all
his homework. But I’ll share a secret,
just between you and me. It wasn’t the
elf; Patrick had done it himself!

SPEAKING
A.

In the story Patrick does difficult things he hates to do, because
the elf pretends he needs help. Have you ever done something
difficult or frightening, by pretending about it in some way?
Tell your classmates about it.
Or
Say what you feel about homework. (The words and phrases in
the boxes may help you.) Do you think it is useful, even though
you may not like it? Form pairs, and speak to each other.

For example:
You may say, “I am not fond of homework.”
Your partner may reply, “But my sister helps me with my
lessons at home, and that gives a boost to my marks.”
(not) be fond of (not) take to (not) develop a liking for
(not) appeal to (not) be keen on (not) have a taste for
support assist with the aid of

WRITING

A. This story has a lot of rhyming words, as a poem does. Can you
write out some parts of it like a poem, so that the rhymes come at
the end of separate lines?

o
n

For example:
Patrick never did homework. “Too boring,” he said.
He played baseball and hockey and Nintendo instead.

B. Look at these sentences.
1. “Too boring,” he said.
2. Cleaned his room, did his chores.
When we speak, we often leave out words that can easily be guessed.
We do not do this when we write, unless we are trying to write
as we speak (as in the story).

14

HONEYSUCKLE

So, if we were to write carefully, we would say:
“Homework is too boring,” he said.
He cleaned his room and did his chores.
C. Rewrite the following incomplete sentences carefully, so that
the reader does not have to guess what is left out.
1. more and more books
2. too difficult
3. got up late, missed the bus
4. solved the mystery
