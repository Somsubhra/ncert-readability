Before you read

What does the title of the poem suggest to you? Are you
reminded of other poems on tigers?

Aunt Jennifer’s tigers prance across a screen,
Bright topaz denizens of a world of green.
They do not fear the men beneath the tree;
They pace in sleek chivalric certainty.

Aunt Jennifer’s fingers fluttering through her wool
Find even the ivory needle hard to pull.
The massive weight of Uncle’s wedding band
Sits heavily upon Aunt Jennifer’s hand.
When Aunt is dead, her terrified hands will lie
Still ringed with ordeals she was mastered by.
The tigers in the panel that she made
Will go on prancing, proud and unafraid.

the tiger’s attitudes?
2. Why do you think Aunt Jennifer’s hands are ‘fluttering through
her wool’ in the second stanza? Why is she finding the needle so
hard to pull?
