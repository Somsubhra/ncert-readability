Listen, sing and dance
I climbed up on the merry-go-round,
And it went round and round.
I climbed up on a big brown horse,
And it went up and down.

One day Mohini was sitting with
her grandmother.

“Can you draw a circle, Mohini?”
“Yes I can.”

Mohini drew three lines on her circle.
It really looked like a ball.

“Oh! It really looks like a balloon.” Mohini clapped with joy.
Mohini drew many circles— big and small circles,
red, blue, green and yellow circles. She also added
zig-zag lines to these.

And now there were many
balloons.
“Can you draw something else
with a circle?” asked Grandmother.

“Yes,” said Mohini.
She drew a wheel, a moon, a
sun, a rabbit and her own face.

Teacher's Pages

Activities now have more to do with what the children like to do. You can try
this:
Make the children sit in a circle. Ask a child to start counting from
l
number 1. The child sitting next to him/her continues with number 2
and so on. The child who has to say number 5 or 10 says chup and the
next child starts with number 1 again.
Draw a circle on the floor with a piece of chalk. Let the children walk
l
along the drawn line. Ask them to hold a book/any object in one hand
and walk along the line. Talk to them about balancing things. Ask them
if they feel giddy on a merry-go-round.
Develop listening skills
4
The children can be taken outdoors during the break and allowed to eat
their snacks there. Let them talk to each other about the different tastes
of foods. Ask children to speak to the point and take turns. Also inculcate
in them a habit of listening when others speak.
Develop pronunciation
4
Read the following words and say aloud with the children:

done through pictures or actions. Use Activity Sheets and a notebook to
further encourage the patterns as on
pages 55, 58, 59, 60 and 61, and any
MATERIAL REQUIRED
