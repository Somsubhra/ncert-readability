Every child is a potential achiever and is different from other
children in her/his style of learning and area of interest.
Read the interview that follows. It is based on a conversation
between Ms Bela Raja, editor of Sparsh, a newsletter from the
Resource Centre, The Valley School, Bangalore, and Mr Hafeez
Contractor, one of India’s leading architects.

Hafeez Contractor was an unhappy school boy.
He loved doing things but detested mechanical learning.
Mathematics gave him the shivers.
What his Principal once said to him influenced him deeply.

HC:

“I used to have this terrible nightmare. Only now, over the
last four to five years, it seems to have disappeared.

BR:

What nightmare are you talking about and why do you think
it has disappeared now?

HC:

I used to get continuous nightmares about appearing for a
maths examination where I did not know anything! Now the
psyche must have gotten over it, I don’t have to think about
education and there is absolutely no time to get nightmares.

nightmare: haunting fear/frightening dream psyche: mind or mentality

BR:
HC:

Tell us something about your earliest memories in school.
In the first and second year I was a good student. After I
reached the third standard, I simply lost interest and I
never studied.
I used to be interested in games, running around, playing
jokes and pranks on others. I would copy in class during
exam times. I would try to get hold of the examination paper
that had been prepared and study it, as I could not
remember things that had been taught to me in class.
However, later, one sentence spoken to me by my
Principal changed my life.
When I approached my eleventh standard, the Principal
called me and said, “Look here, Son, I have been seeing you
from day one. You are a good student, but you never studied.
I have taken care of you till today. Now, I can no longer take
care of you so you do it yourself.”
He talked to me for five minutes, “You don’t have your
father, your mother has worked so hard to bring you up and
paid all your fees all these years but you have only played
games. Now you should rise to the occasion and study.”
I used to be a very good sportsman. I had been the senior
champion for so many years and I also was the cricket captain.
I used to play every game, but that year I did not step out
onto the field.
I would go for prayers and all I would do was eat and
study. I normally used to copy and pass, but I realised that
once I was in SSC, I could not do that.
When I got a second class, 50 per cent, in my SSC my
Principal said, “Son, consider yourself as having got a
distinction!” This is my memory of my school days.
I did lots of other things. See, as far as my things are
concerned, I can’t remember. I forget things very easily. To
remember, I have to see things as a photograph. I read a

as far as my things are concerned: perhaps he is referring to matters other than course
materials and their details

book and I can
remember the matter
as a photograph but
not through my mind.
That is how it works.
BR:

When you were in
school and you were
doing badly, did the
teachers pull you up
and how did you feel?

HC:

I never felt anything
on being pulled up. I used to be so interested in playing. I
would receive a caning every week.

BR:

When you knew that you had incurred the wrath of your teacher
by not doing your homework or by behaving badly, when you
knew you would get a caning, what was the state of your mind?

HC:

State of mind? Just lift up the hand and they would cane
you. It would hurt badly and then I would have to forget
about it, because I would want to go and play.

BR:

You never felt insecure or threatened?

HC:

I was just interested in playing and nothing else. I was most interested in funny pranks. One day, I did not want to study, so I
created a distraction. For one whole hour we played ‘chor police’.
Every Saturday we were allowed to go into town to see a
movie. So what I would do was have no lunch and collect
money from 40 – 50 students, and run and buy the tickets.
On my way back, I would eat to my heart’s content.
I used to be the leader of a gang. We would have gang
fights and plan strategies. These things used to interest me
more than any academics.

He stumbled on architecture because he knew little French and
less German.
He was offbeat even in the pranks that he played on others.
When he found his calling, there was no looking back.

BR:

How did you get into the field of architecture?

HC:

In the college for architecture, nobody who had got below
80 – 85 per cent was allowed to enter. I had only 50 per cent.
I wanted to join the Army. I got my admission letter but
my aunt tore it up. Then I decided that I wanted to join the
police force.
My mother said, “Don’t join the police force, just do your
graduation!” So I went to Jaihind College in Bombay.
There, I was to either take French or German. Though I
had studied French for seven years, I did not know seven
words of French. So I took German. Then my German teacher
died. The college told me that I could change the college or

take French. Now, who would give me admission in another
college? I had got admission to Jaihind by influence.
So I thought, ‘Okay, I will take French’ and I started learning
French again. I learnt it from my cousin. She was an architect’s wife.
I was going to an architect’s office to learn French!
BR:

Was it then that you decided you wanted to do architecture?

HC:

Actually, it all happened quite by chance.
In the architect’s office, I saw somebody drawing a window
detail. A window detail is a very advanced drawing.
I told him that his drawing was wrong — that the window
he had drawn would not open.
He then had a bet with me and later he found that indeed, his
drawing was wrong! My cousin’s husband was surprised. He
asked me to draw a few specific things, which I immediately did.
He asked me to design a house and I designed a house.
After that, he told me to drop everything and join architecture.
We went to meet the Principal of the college.
The Principal warned me, “I will allow you to take part in the
entrance exams, but if you do not do well I will not allow
you to join.”
I got an ‘A+’ in the entrance exam and from that day it
was a cakewalk.
I had never made a plan, but I knew how something looked
like, from the top.
I had never known what a section was, but I knew if you
cut a plan what it would look like.
I stood first class first throughout, after that.
I believe that all this understanding came from what I used
to play and do during school.
I had a friend called Behram Divecha. We used to have
competitions between us for designing forts, guns and ammunition.
Each of us would design something in an effort to be different.

In school, when I was in the second or third standard, one
of my teachers, Mrs Gupta, saw my sketches and told me,
“See, you are useless in everything else but your sketches are
good. When you grow up you become an architect”. I did not
know at the time but she was right. Later, after I became an
architect, I went back to meet her and tell her.
BR:
HC:

Why do you think you did not like studies? Was it because you
felt you could not cope, could not deal with the curriculum?
I was very bad at languages. Science and geography I could
deal with, maths was very bad. I just was not interested. I was
studying for the sake of studying. What they taught me today,
I would forget after two days. I would not bother because
there was no application of mind there, to begin with.

BR:

Did you think that what they taught in school was boring or
did you feel that once you understood the concept of what
was being taught, you lost interest in the rest of the lesson?

HC:

Living in a boarding school is difficult. We were just living
from day to day.
Nowadays, there are so many tests. Back then, whenever
we had tests we used to just copy. The teacher thought that
we had done our work.
There is a contention that giftedness and learning disabilities
go hand in hand. Do you think this applies to you?

BR:
HC:

Well, take some students from my class. Those who always
stood first or second are today doing very ordinary jobs.

BR:

I have come across this situation in so many different places
where people tell me that their class toppers are doing very
ordinarily today.

HC:

In school, I think living our lives there made us street smart.
I have learnt more by doing what I did on my own than

what academics would have
taught me.
That is because the
personality and skills were
there. You were able to find
expression in a manner you
were comfortable with and
you defied every rule so that
nobody would stop you from
doing what you needed to do.
I was more interested in other
things. If, for example, while
in class, it started raining
outside, I would think of the
flowing water and how to
build a dam to block it. I
Complex designed by
Hafeez Contractor
would be thinking about the
flow of water within the dam and how much of water the dam
would be able to hold. That was my interest for the day.
When students lost a button while playing or fighting,
they would come running to me and I would cut a button for
them from chalk, using a blade. Discipline in the school was
very important and no student could afford to have a button
missing. The student would get past dinner with a full neat
uniform and after that it did not matter.

BR:

Coming to the present, how do you decide as to what kind of
structure you want to give a client?

HC:

I look at the client’s face, his clothes, the way he talks and
pronounces, the way he eats and I would know what his taste
would be like. I can relate to people in a way that would be
comfortable. I sketch very spontaneously on a paper on the
spot. That paper, I give to my people in the office.

Call it instinct, call it arithmetic, whatever. Now it comes to

and sociology together and making a sketch from all that is
‘mathematics’.

Here we almost come to a full circle where Mr Contractor has derived
his own interpretation of Mathematics — taking it from a subject
he hated to a subject he now loves dealing with!
