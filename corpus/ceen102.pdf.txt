SUGGESTIONS FOR CLASSROOM TEACHING
Warm
l

up activity can be done by reading the pre-reading questions aloud to
introduce the theme or topic of the poem.

Read and re-read the poem aloud laying stress on certain words and phrases.
l
Take
l

children for a Nature walk outdoors. Point to the birds they may see on
the trees or flying about. Encourage them to look for birds and listen
attentively to their sounds. Let the children express their thoughts and
feelings freely.

Talk
l

about differences between different kinds of birds, e.g. in size, shape,
colour, beaks, sounds etc.

Discuss
l

how birds are different from us. People can be different from each
other too. Talk about differences with special reference to children with
special needs, e.g. visually handicapped or physically challenged. Discuss
how such children can excel in other fields like music, art etc.

Read
l

the story aloud to the children. The story may be retold with the help of
the pictures. Encourage children to guess the meanings of difficult words,
before you explain.

Read
l

instructions for the bird activity and help children to make a bird-bath
and a feeding corner. Show them how to make finger puppets. Explain the
position and names of the fingers to children. Encourage themebased conversation.

Children
l

could be asked to bring pictures of birds to class. Help
them to make small charts and put these up for the class to see.

Discuss with children how sparrows are becoming fewer in cities
l
and towns. What would this mean for us?

Bird Talk

‘Think...’ said the robin,
‘Think...’ said the jay,
sitting in the garden
talking one day.

‘Think about people
the way they grow:
they don’t have feathers
at all, you know.

They don’t eat beetles,
they don’t grow wings,
they don’t like sitting
on wires and things.’

‘Think!’ said the robin.
‘Think!’ said the jay.
‘Aren’t people funny
to be that way?’

New words
beetles, sitting, wires, funny

NINA AND THE BABY SPARROWS

There was great joy in Nina’s house. Nina's aunt was getting

Her mother took her to the market to buy a new dress.

“What colour would you like?” Mother asked.

“I don't want a new dress, Mother,” said Nina.

“Salwar-kameez then?”
Nina shook her head.

“What about those lovely white shoes you saw last week?”

“I don't want those, either. Thank you, Mother.”

Nina’s mother was upset, but she said nothing. They went
back home and had lunch. After lunch mother came and sat near
Nina. “What is it, child?” she asked. “Why did you say 'no' to
everything?”

“But why?”

think, Nina...
while you
enjoy yourself at
the wedding, the baby
sparrows will be getting nice
and fat in their nest. Good
idea, isn’t it?”

“Mother, I don’t want to
go to the wedding.”
Nina said nothing.
Instead, two big tears
rolled down her cheeks.
Mother put her arms
around Nina. “Don’t cry,
my pet,” she said. "Why
don't you tell me what’s
bothering you?”

It was a good idea.
When Nina came back from
the wedding, there were two
plump little sparrows flying
all over the room. And wasn't
Nina thrilled!

More tears rolled
down Nina’s cheeks.
“ M o t h e r, ” s h e s a i d ,
“there’s a sparrow’s nest
on the bookshelf in my
room. And there are two
baby sparrows in the nest.”
“I see...” said mother.

“They’re just beginning to get their feathers. And growing up
makes them so hungry. All day long they cry ‘cheep-cheep’,
asking for food.”
“I see!” said Mother.

“If we go, the whole place will be locked. And how will papa
and mama sparrows feed their babies?”
“Oh Nina,” cried Mother, giving her a big hug. “Is that why you
don’t want to go to the wedding? But that’s no problem at all.
We’ll leave the window open.”
“Oh, can we, Mother? Can we? Really?”

“Yes, yes. We’ll remove all your things from the room and lock
the door on the outside. So the house will be perfectly safe and
papa and mama sparrows can come and go freely, too. Just
