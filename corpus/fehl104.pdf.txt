Tragedy in Space
U.S. Space Shuttle Columbia
breaks into flames
In an unprecedented
space tragedy, U.S. Space
Shuttle Columbia, carrying
India-born
American
astronaut
Kalpana
Chawla and six others,
broke apart in flames as
it streaked over Texas
towards its landing strip
on Saturday, 1 February
2003, killing all seven
on board.
The shuttle lost contact
with NASA at about 9 a.m.
(19.30 hrs 1ST) as it came
in for landing. It was flying
at an altitude of over

200,000 feet and travelling
at over 20,000 km. per hour
when ground control lost
contact with the shuttle.
Columbia had lifted off
on 16 January 2003, from
the Kennedy Space Center,
Florida. It had stayed
in orbit for 16 days and
the seven-member crew
conducted 80 experiments
before it began its downward
journey, which ended in
tragedy. This was Columbia’s
28th space flight and the
shuttle was said to be good
for 100 flights.

1. KALPANA Chawla said that she never
dreamed, as a child in Karnal, that she
would cross the frontiers of space. It was
enough that her parents allowed her to
attend engineering college after she
graduated from Tagore School.
2.
After a Bachelor of Science degree in
aeronautical engineering, against great
opposition from her father, she went for
a master’s degree to the United States
of America. She later earned her Ph.D.
in aerospace engineering. Kalpana
Chawla was the first Indian–American
woman astronaut to blast off from the

launch pad at Cape Canaveral, Florida,
and participate in a successful mission
in space. Her family from India cheered
along with staff at the Kennedy Space
Center as they watched the Columbia
lift off.
3.
Kalpana was born in Karnal, Haryana,
but was a naturalised U.S. citizen,
married to flight instructor Jean-Pierre
Harrison. Besides being an astronaut,
she was licensed to fly single and multiengine land airplanes, single-engine
seaplanes and gliders. She was also a
certified flight instructor. After

qualifying as a pilot, Kalpana began to
consider another challenge: applying to
NASA’s space shuttle program. She was
first hired as a research scientist at
NASA. In 1994 she was selected by
NASA for training as an astronaut.
4.
When asked what it was like being a
woman in her field she replied, “I really
never, ever thought, while pursuing my
studies or doing anything else, that I
was a woman, or a person from a small
city, or a different country. I pretty
much had my dreams like anyone else
and I followed them. And people who
were around me, fortunately, always
encouraged me and said, ‘If that’s what
you want to do, carry on’.”
5.
Kalpana’s first space mission in the
space shuttle, Columbia, was 15 days,
16 hours and 34 minutes long. During
this time she went around the earth 252
times, travelling 10.45 million
kilometres! The crew included a
Japanese and a Ukranian astronaut.
The crew performed experiments such
as pollinating plants to observe food
growth in space, and tests for making
stronger metals and faster computer
chips — all for a price tag of about
56 million dollars.
6.
On the Saturday night when the
news about the Columbia disaster
broke, there was shock and disbelief.

The town of Karnal spent a sleepless
night as thousands of households
stayed glued to their television sets in
the hope that Kalpana and the crew had
somehow survived. A journalist wrote:

o
n

She was a heroine. It takes enormous
ability to become an astronaut. You need
to know a lot about everything, from biology
to astrophysics to aeronautical engineering.
In this age of super -specialisation, you
must have encyclopaedic knowledge
to be an astronaut. Her achievement is
awe-inspiring.

For millions of young Indians, the
story of Kalpana Chawla, a girl from a
small town who touched the skies, had
become an inspiration. In a message
that she sent from aboard the space
shuttle, Columbia, to students of her
college in Chandigarh, Kalpana said,
“The path from dreams to success does
exist. May you have the vision to find
it, the courage to get onto it… . Wishing
you a great journey.” There will surely
be many who start off on this journey
to fulfil their dreams.

Beauty
What is beauty? Try to describe what beauty is, or list some of
the things or persons you think are beautiful.
Now let us read a poem on beauty.

Beauty is seen
In the sunlight,
The trees, the birds,
Corn growing and people working
Or dancing for their harvest.

Beauty is heard
In the night,
Wind sighing, rain falling,
Or a singer chanting
Anything in earnest.

Beauty is in yourself.
Good deeds, happy thoughts
That repeat themselves
In your dreams,
In your work,
And even in your rest.

WORKING

WITH THE

POEM

1. The poet says, “Beauty is heard in …”
Can you hear beauty? Add a sound that you think is beautiful to
the sounds the poet thinks are beautiful.
The poet, Shelley, said:

d
e
h

Heard melodies are sweet,
But those unheard are sweeter.

What do you think this means? Have you ever ‘heard’ a song in
your head, long after the song was sung or played?

2. Read the first and second stanzas of the poem again. Note the
following phrases.
corn growing, people working or dancing, wind sighing,
rain falling, a singer chanting
These could be written as
•
•

corn that is growing
people who are working or dancing

Can you rewrite the other phrases like this? Why do you think the
poet uses the shorter phrases?
3. Find pictures of beautiful things you have seen or heard of.
4. Write a paragraph about beauty. Use your own ideas along with
the ideas in the poem. (You may discuss your ideas with your
partner.)
