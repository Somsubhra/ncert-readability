The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends
that children's life at school must be linked to their life outside
the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of
bookish learning which continues to shape our system and
causes a gap between the school, home and community. The
syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an
attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to
discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these
measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a
child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy
of Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school
principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect
on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and
questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom,
children generate new knowledge by engaging with the
information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed
textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons
why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating
creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children
as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body
of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines
and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as
necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so
that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted
to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will
also determine how effective this book proves for making
children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source
of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address
the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and
reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater
consideration for child psychology and the time available for

teaching. The supplementary reader attempts to enhance this
endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities
for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups,
and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training
(NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook
development committee responsible for this book. We wish to
thank the Chairperson of the advisory committee
for textbooks in languages for the secondary stage,
Professor Namwar Singh, and the Chief Advisor for this book,
Professor R. Amritavalli for guiding the work of this committee.
Several teachers contributed to the development of this
supplementary reader; we are grateful to their principals for
making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and
organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon
their resources, materials and personnel. We are especially
grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee,
appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher
Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development
under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and
Professor G.P. Deshpande for their valuable time and
contribution. As an organisation committed to systemic reform
and continuous improvement in the quality of its products,
NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable
us to undertake further revision and refinements.

Footprints without Feet, a supplementary reader in English for
Class X, is based on the new syllabus prepared as a follow-up to
the National Curriculum Framework, 2005. The curriculum
envisages language learning opportunities that are rich in
comprehensible input, and adopts a language-across-thecurriculum, multilingual perspective on English in the school.
Input-rich communicational environments are a prerequisite
for language learning. Therefore, learners must be exposed to a
variety of texts.
The supplementary reader is meant for students to read on
their own; it aims at developing their reading skills. Learners
need to develop the habit of reading for information and
pleasure, drawing inferences from what they read, and relating
texts to their previous knowledge. They need to learn to
read critically and to develop the confidence to ask and
answer questions.
The selections in the supplementary reader take into
account the interests of young learners while making them
aware of issues that they need to reflect on: personal
relationships, the neighbourhood, and the community. Thematic
variety has been taken care of and there is a good representation
of a variety of genres as well as of writers from across the world—
Indian, British, French, American and Japanese. This
supplementary reader has ten pieces including a play and a
factual prose piece, as well as science fiction.
Each piece begins with questions under the head ‘Read and
Find Out’ to guide learners in their reading and comprehension
of the text, which is divided into two to three sections, each
section prefaced with relevant questions. Thus the texts do
not need to be read out or explained by the teacher in class.
Word glosses have similarly been kept to the minimum so as
to encourage inferences about meaning from sentential
and discourse contexts. The teacher, after a quick oral
comprehension check, if necessary, can progress to the questions

under the head ‘Think About It’ at the end of each unit. These
are meant to take the learner beyond factual comprehension to
contemplate on the issues that the texts raise; the questions are
open ended and thought provoking.
The questions given under ‘Talk About It’ are intended to
encourage the learners to express their own ideas in a creative
and coherent way. It is hoped that the topics suggested for
discussion will encourage learners to develop a constructive
analysis of the relevant issues, involving critical thinking,
reasoning, and previous knowledge as well as new knowledge.
The list of suggested readings given at the end of each story
is meant to encourage learners to read further on their own.
The idea is to promote the habit of self-learning and reduce
dependence on the teacher.
Language learning is essentially a matter of acquiring in an
integrated way the skills of listening, speaking, reading and
writing; and of honing these skills for effective communication
in the classroom, and later in real life. This book offers an
opportunity for taking learners in that direction.
