FOREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework, (NCF) 2005, recommends that
children's life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning
which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the
school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed
on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea.
They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance
of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these
measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a childcentred system of education outlined in the National Policy on
Education (1986).

The success of this effort depends on the steps that school
principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on
their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions.
We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children
generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on
to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis
of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and
sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is
possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning,
not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.

These aims imply considerable change in school routines and
mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary
as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required
number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The
methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how
effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a
happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus
designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by
restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with
greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for
teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving
higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and
wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring
hands-on experience.

A NOTE

FOR THE

TEACHER

Woven Words is based on the new syllabus in English prepared in
consonance with the spirit of the National Curriculum Framework
2005. This textbook is designed for students who have opted to study
English as an elective subject at the higher secondary stage. The
main objectives of this book are to help students
• read literary texts with pleasure and understanding
• develop critical thinking and literary appreciation
• develop a sensitivity to the nuances of language.

Woven Words is an integrated book consisting of three sections
namely, short stories, poems and essays representative of literature
in English from around the world. Most of the short stories included
here are by contemporary writers. There is a fair share of Indian
Writing in English with Mulk Raj Anand, Bhabani Bhattacharya,
Arundhati Roy and Jhumpa Lahiri reflecting rural, urban and
diasporic experiences. The Rocking Horse by D.H. Lawrence and The
Luncheon by Somerset Maugham add native English flavour to the
collection, and the Sherlock Holmes story would definitely appeal
to youngsters looking for some thrill in reading. Chekhov’s The
Lament, a touching account of insensitivity to bereavement,
underscores the universality of the human condition.
The aim of this selection is to make learners approach reading
as a pleasurable activity. The stories are followed by exercises under
four heads—textual comprehension, talking about the texts, literary
appreciation and language work. These aim at fostering critical
reading in the learners and instilling in them the confidence to
express their responses. The second head encourages learners to
discuss their responses with each other in pairs or small groups.
The poetry selection, representing different forms such as the
lyric, sonnet and ode, reflects some of the pressing concerns of the
contemporary world such as racial discrimination (Wole Soyinka’s
Telephone Conversation and W.H. Auden’s Refugee Blues),
marginalisation of languages (Padma Sachdev’s Mother Tongue),
environmental issues (Dilip Chitre’s Felling of the Banyan Tree),
manipulative politics (Arun Kolatkar’s satire, Ajamil and the Tigers),
and sensitive comment on human relationships (Nissim Ezekiel’s
For Elkana and Philip Larkin’s Coming). Hawk Roosting by Ted Hughes
brings out the parallel in human behaviour to the predatory instincts

of animals while Sujata Bhatt’s The Peacock is a delightful
visualisation of the bird’s colours and grace of movement. Also
included are all-time classics: pieces of enduring charm and appeal
from Shakespeare, Wordsworth and Keats. Forms like the limerick
and the haiku add variety to the reading experience and introduce
an element of light humour and fun.
The activities suggested for the poems are directed more at
eliciting sensitive responses to the issues and the language rather
than detailed textual comprehension. Difficult words have not been
glossed as the aim is to encourage learners to make intelligent
guesses or refer to the dictionary when they encounter unfamiliar
terms. However, allusions to Greek mythology have been explained.
A glossary of literary forms and terms has been provided at the end
of the book.
While the content of most of the essays provides for serious
reading, Mark Twain’s My Watch is a humorous piece that lightens
the section. Bertrand Russell’s The Three Passions, a short excerpt
from his autobiography, introduces students to a philosopher’s
perspectives on life and its primary concerns. Three of the essays
are speeches recorded in writing. John Ruskin’s What is a Good
Book?, an excerpt from Sesame and Lilies, and E.M. Forster’s piece
on the elements of a good story, from Aspects of the Novel, prepare
learners for literary criticism. S. Chandrasekhar’s lecture, Patterns
of Creativity, explores the relationship between poetry and science.
G.N. Devy’s Tribal Verse, in another strain, familiarises students
with recent trends in looking at literature from non-conventional
standpoints bringing in oral folk traditions into its fold. Kumudini
Lakhia’s autobiographical extract from Women Who Dared gives
expression to an artist’s approach to life and art.
The tasks that follow the essays demand learners’ engagement
with the texts and lead them on to a deep understanding of life and
language. Teachers should help learners move towards reading with
discernment.
The following are recommended for additional reading:
The Outsider by Albert Camus; A Doll’s House by Henrik Ibsen;
Pygmalion by G.B.Shaw and Dancing in Cambodia and Other Stories
by Amitav Ghosh.
It is hoped that this course will lay the foundations for a study
of English language and literature at the tertiary level of education.
