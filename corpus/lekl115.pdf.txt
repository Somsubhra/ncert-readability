Emily Dickinson
1830-1886

Emily Dickinson is regarded as one of
America’s quintessential poets of the nineteenth
century. She lived an introverted and hermetic
life, and published very few of her poems in
her lifetime. Her output, 1789 poems in all, were
published posthumously.
Her poetry is characterised by unconventional
capitalisation and extensive use of dashes,
along with unusual imagery and lyric style.

The Trees like Tassels hit – and – swung –
There seemed to rise a Tune
From Miniature Creatures
Accompanying the Sun –
Far Psalteries of Summer –
Enamoring the Ear
They never yet did satisfy –
Remotest – when most fair

o
n

The Sun shone whole at intervals –
Then Half – then utter hid –
As if Himself were optional
And had Estates of Cloud
Sufficient to enfold Him
Eternally from view –
Except it were a whim of His
To let the Orchards grow –

108/KALEIDOSCOPE

A Bird sat careless on the fence –
One gossiped in the Lane
On silver matters charmed a Snake
Just winding round a Stone –
Bright Flowers slit a Calyx
And soared upon a Stem
Like Hindered Flags – Sweet hoisted –
With Spices – in the Hem –

’Twas more – I cannot mention –
How mean – to those that see
Vandyke’s Delineation
Of Nature’s – Summer Day!

day?

How would you explain the image of the ‘Hindered Flags’?

Why are the pronouns referring to the Sun capitalised?

Give examples from the poem to show that great poetry is a

You came across ‘dulcimer’ in the poem ‘Kubla Khan’. Did you
note down ‘Psaltery’ as another musical instrument? They are
very similar. Look up the illustrations for the two in an
illustrated dictionary. Find out in what ways they are different
from one another.
