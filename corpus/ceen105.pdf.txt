The Balloon Man

l
Appreciation of natural beauty

He always comes on market days

SUGGESTIONS FOR CLASSROOM TEACHING
l
With

Does a balloon man visit your market? Let’s see what this
balloon man brings with him.

a new poem, ask children to remember words and outstanding lines.
While reading, let children look for lines they like best, enjoy them and make a
picture of them ‘‘in their minds’’.

And holds balloons – a lovely bunch –
And in the market square he stays,
And never seems to think of lunch.

You can bring a packet of brightly coloured balloons and thread to class. Take
l
the children out into the playground. Let each child blow one balloon and tie it
tightly with a piece of thread. Now let them leave the balloons and watch them
fly up with the breeze. Talk about how high they will fly in the sky. Talk also
about the other things one can see in the sky including birds, butterflies,
balloons, clouds etc. and their different colours.
The story must be read in a clear
l

voice, and appropriate expressions so that it
is told well and will live in the memory of the children.

Take
l

children outdoors if possible, where they see butterflies on flowers and
tell them about how they feed on nectar. Draw the body of a butterfly on the
blackboard. Talk to the children about its different parts.

Paper folding activity: Give every child a square piece of paper. Let them colour
it with dots and lines before making a butterfly.
Help
l

children to make colourful balloons by cutting pictures from old
magazines and newspapers. They can stick these on chart papers and put
them up in the class.

Help
l

children to find out the colours in the maze by reading the
letters vertically and horizontally.

Explain
l

the difficult words in the text. You can supply pictures
for them. Write new sentences on the blackboard. This way you
can also teach words and spaces and later a long word,
a sentence etc. Jumbled sentences can be presented in some
attractive way to be corrected by the child.

They're red and purple, blue and green,
And when it is a sunny day

The carts and people get between
You see them shining far away.

And some are big and some are small,
All tied together with a string.
And if there is a wind at all

They tug and tug like anything.

Some day perhaps he'll let them go

And we shall see them sailing high,

And stand and watch them from below —
They would look pretty in the sky!

Where did the butterfly go?
Near the garden was a pond. In
the pond was a white lotus.
Around it grew round leaves.
They floated in the water.

The butterfly sailed on a floating leaf.
Sonu went splash into the water and...
Off flew the butterfly!

Where was it? Sonu looked up, he looked down.
Near the wall was a peach tree. It had pink flowers. The
butterfly sat on a pretty flower.
“I can catch you!” shouted Sonu. He climbed up
the tree. Up, up he climbed, but....
Back it flew, down from the tree.

Sonu jumped down too. He
chased the butterfly,
From the rose,

to the lotus, and,

Up the peach tree, but...

He could not catch the
butterfly.

He let the
butterfly go. It sat
on the red rose. It
flew to the peach
tree and then sailed
on a lotus leaf. It
flew merrily from
flower to flower.

There was a big spider's
web in the peach tree. The
butterfly was caught in the
spider's web. It looked sad
as it tried to escape. It
fluttered its wings. It twisted
and turned. But it could not
escape. The spider’s web
held it tight.

Poor butterfly!

Sonu watched it
fly and fly.

The butterfly flew all around Sonu’s garden....happy
and free once again.

In the middle of the web was a big spider. It looked hungry.

Nilima Sinha

It wanted to catch the butterfly.

New words

Closer and closer crawled the black spider.
