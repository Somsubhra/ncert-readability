FOREWORD

no

THE National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning
which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the
school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on
the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They
also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures
will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred
system of education outlined in the National Policy of Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals
and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own
learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must
recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new
knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.
Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one
of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.
Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat
children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of
knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode
of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as
rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required
number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods
used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this
book proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience,
rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have
tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring
and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration
for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The
supplementary reader attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving
higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and
wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring
hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training
(NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development

committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson
of the advisory group in languages, Professor Namwar Singh and the
Chief Advisor for this book, Professor R. Amritavalli for guiding the
work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the
development of this supplementary reader; we are grateful to their
principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions
and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon
their resources, materials and personnel. We are especially grateful
to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by
the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of
Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of
Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande for their valuable
time and contribution. As an organisation committed to systemic
reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products,
NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to
undertake further revision and refinements.

A NOTE

no

MOMENTS, a supplementary reader in English for Class IX, is meant for
extensive reading. It is designed to promote a love for reading by exposing
the learners to a variety of materials.
An attempt has been made to provide learners with a rich reading
experience through stories of mystery, adventure, courage, growing
up, romance, wit and humour. These carefully selected pieces would
cater to the needs and interests of adolescents and hold the mirror up
to different aspects of life and people.
A deliberate effort has been made to gloss only some potentially
difficult words in the stories to aid the reading process. The few
questions given under ‘Think about It’ are all global questions, designed
to help learners develop their ability of intelligent and imaginative
reading. The ‘Talk about It’ section has discussion topics which take a
constructive approach to the analysis of contemporary issues. The
learners may be encouraged to interact with their classmates or seniors,
integrate their understanding of the issues and make a purposeful,
personalised, and imaginative oral presentation. A list of suggested
readings is given at the end of each story to encourage learners to
read extensively and independently.
