A Little Fish Story
There are a great many million fish in the seas, but this story is
about just one of them, and a very small one at
that.

through the mesh and slipped back into the cool clear water. How

Now this little fish had everything in
the seas to make him contented, but he
was not happy. You will laugh when I
tell you why he was not. He was
unhappy because he was so very small.

“It is very hard to be such a little mite
of a fish!” he would say, over and over
again. “If I were only larger, how much
happier I could be.” And he said it so many
times that I think he believed it.

One day he was swimming along with the rest of his school
and thinking, no doubt, how much more the larger fish had to be
thankful for than he, when suddenly, with no warning, they
found themselves in the meshes of a great net.
There was much floundering and
splashing as the net was drawn
up out of the water into the
sunlight, and just as its
haul was being

He swam here and there and
everywhere, and some of the fish who
knew him well all the rest of his life, said
that they never again heard him say that
he wished to be anything but a little fish.

the children to recite the poem with appropriate actions and

gestures.

Help children to find rhyming words and opposites.
l
Explain the difficult words in the text.
l
Let the
l

children try to say the tongue twister (She sells sea-shells…) aloud as
clearly as they can. These and some more like Shoes and socks shock Shyam,
Bring back buttons, beans, and buns etc., can be said quite slowly at first and
the speed can be increased later.

Encourage the children to make different sounds.
l

The story can be read aloud with expression and gestures. The children can be
l
given ideas and opportunities to express themselves. World building can
become an interesting game as children practise correct pronunciation and
build up words.
You can
l

talk about disaster management as in the case of accidents, floods,
fire and earthquakes. What are the safety measures to be taken? How can we
help victims? Introduce terms like ‘tsunami’. Let them talk about stories they
have heard about the tsunami, earthquakes etc.

Ask the
l

children whether they eat fish. Tell them about the
different kinds of fish in the sea and other water animals, big and
small, and about their life underwater.

This unit
l

can introduce the important issue of water pollution by
man and its harmful effects on sea life.
