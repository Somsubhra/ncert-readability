4. Essay-writing
MOST of us find it difficult to begin writing. We can make this
easier by thinking about the topic either through brainstorming,
that is with several people in a group giving their ideas as they
strike them, or by putting them down on a sheet of paper as
they occur to us.
For example, if the topic is ‘Hobbies’, we can draw a circle and
write ‘hobbies’ in it:

Then we can put down our thoughts as they come to us in a
random manner as shown below.

Having done that we select the points and expand each into a
sentence.
1. Hobbies are free-time activities. Examples are stampcollecting, painting etc.
2. They are matters of personal choice, not forced.
3. They are interesting and give pleasure.
4. They refresh the mind by providing an opportunity to do
different kinds of activities.
5. They provide relief from monotony.
6. They help us channelise our energy.
7. They can also be useful activities and can provide pleasure
to others. For example, reading out to visually impaired
people, visiting art exhibitions, music concerts etc.
8. Hobbies are educative and they widen our general
knowledge.
9. They help us develop our overall personality.
10. They serve as a medium for the expression of our creativity.
11. We meet interesting people through our common interests
and develop friendships.

We usually begin a topic with a definition or short description.
We could begin thus:
Hobbies are activities that we engage in, in our free time.
We may be interested in needlework, drawing and
painting or music. Other common hobbies are stampcollecting, clay-modelling, solving crossword puzzles.
Although hobbies also entail work they are taken upon
through one’s own personal choice. They are not forced
upon us. They are activities that we are really interested
in and hence give us a great deal of pleasure.
Hobbies make life interesting. They refresh our minds
after a hard day’s work. We need to do something different
in order to do our routine work effectively. Hobbies provide
this variety.
Hobbies relieve us from the monotony of daily life.
They fill us with enthusiasm for work and keep our energy
levels high. We will go to any extent to get the things that
we require, to get the utmost joy from our hobbies.

Hobbies are also useful activities. Quite a few hobbies,
like stamp-collecting, widen our general knowledge about
various countries of the world. When we share common
interests we even get into correspondence with people of
other countries.

This is how we write an essay.
A composition on a particular subject consisting of more than
one paragraph is an essay. The characteristics of a good
essay are:
Unity

:

Coherence :

Relevance :
Proportion:

The essay should deal with the main subject, and
all parts of it should be clearly linked with that
subject.
There should be a logical sequence of thought. This
requires a logical relationship between ideas,
sentences and paragraphs.
Unimportant information should not be included.
Giving more space to the important ideas.

Read the following essay and the passage analysis that follows
it carefully.

The Importance of Games

1. “The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton.”
These words have been attributed to the Duke of Wellington.
Certainly one does not play games in order to win battles;
neither does the curriculum include them for that reason.
But the importance of games in life should not be
underestimated, for without them it is harder for a person to
be sound in body and mind.
2. For one thing, if a person is to fulfil all the duties that society
expects of him, it is important for him to keep healthy. He
may be very intelligent, but that has little meaning if he cannot
make use of his intelligence, because he is always suffering
from bad health. In some ways, the human body is like a
machine. If it is not made use of, it starts to work badly.
People who are not fit grow weak and become more susceptible
to disease. Any form of game is useful, provided it gives the
body an opportunity to take regular physical exercise.

3.

Secondly, playing — and therefore experiencing winning
and losing — encourages the spirit of sportsmanship, thus
enabling one to deal with life’s problems in a wise and natural
manner. Games teach the truth embodied in the Olympic
motto: ‘The important thing in playing is not the winning or
the losing, but the participation’ — and, I may add, doing
the best one can.
4.
We have to remember some other things about playing
games, however. First, it is the physical exercise that is
important for health, not the games themselves, and there
are other ways of getting this. Is not India the home of yoga?
It is also possible to be too interested in games. When we
think of the Greek ideal expressed in the Latin phrase, ‘mens
sana in corpore sano’ (a healthy mind in a healthy body), we
should not forget that it is the mind which is mentioned
first. And if we let games become the most important thing
in our lives, we may be in danger of changing the Olympic
motto to ‘the important thing is winning’.
5.
Nevertheless, in spite of these dangers, playing games can
be a valuable activity, and if we take part in them wisely, we
can gain great benefits.
